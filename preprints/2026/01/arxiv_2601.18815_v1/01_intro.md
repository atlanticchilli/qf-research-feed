###### Abstract

Prediction markets are often described as mechanisms that “aggregate information” into prices, yet the mapping from dispersed private information to observed market histories is typically noisy, endogenous, and shaped by heterogeneous and strategic participation. This paper formulates prediction markets as Bayesian inverse problems in which the unknown event outcome Y∈{0,1}Y\in\{0,1\} is inferred from an observed history of market-implied probabilities and traded volumes. We introduce a mechanism-agnostic observation model in log-odds space in which price increments conditional on volume arise from a latent mixture of trader types. The resulting likelihood class encompasses informed and uninformed trading, heavy-tailed microstructure noise, and adversarial or manipulative flow, while requiring only price and volume as observables.

Within this framework we define posterior uncertainty quantification for YY, provide identifiability and well-posedness criteria in terms of Kullback–Leibler separation between outcome-conditional increment laws, and derive posterior concentration statements and finite-sample error bounds under general regularity assumptions. We further study stability of posterior odds to perturbations of the observed price–volume path and define realized and expected information gain via the posterior-vs-prior KL divergence and mutual information. The inverse-problem formulation yields explicit diagnostics for regimes in which market histories are informative and stable versus regimes in which inference is ill-posed due to type-composition confounding or outcome–nuisance symmetries.

Extensive experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical predictions regarding posterior concentration rates and identifiability thresholds.

### 1 Introduction

Prediction markets are widely deployed as forecasting tools, as information elicitation mechanisms, and as components of decentralized oracle architectures (Arrow et al., [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib1 "The promise of prediction markets"); Wolfers and Zitzewitz, [2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib2 "Prediction markets")). In many theoretical treatments, the market-implied probability is interpreted as a posterior belief and the market itself is treated as an efficient aggregator of dispersed information (Manski, [2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib3 "Interpreting the predictions of prediction markets"); Gjerstad, [2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib9 "Risk aversion, beliefs, and prediction market equilibrium")). In practice, however, market prices and volumes are generated by heterogeneous participants with varying information quality, risk preferences, budgets, latency, and strategic incentives. The resulting market history is a noisy and endogenous observation of the underlying event outcome. From the standpoint of inference, prediction markets can therefore be viewed as *stochastic sensing systems*, and the central question becomes: what can be reliably inferred about the outcome from the observed market history, and with what quantified uncertainty?

This paper develops a Bayesian inverse-problem formulation of that question in a setting where the analyst observes only a price path (expressed as a market-implied probability) and a volume process. The unknown event outcome is binary, Y∈{0,1}Y\in\{0,1\}, and the observable history over a finite horizon consists of pairs (pt,vt)(p\_{t},v\_{t}) where pt∈(0,1)p\_{t}\in(0,1) is a market-implied probability and vt≥0v\_{t}\geq 0 is the traded volume over an interval or at an event time. The key modeling challenge is that the observation operator mapping YY to (pt,vt)(p\_{t},v\_{t}) is mediated by unobserved agent-level behavior. We treat this mediation explicitly by introducing latent trader *types* whose aggregate effect on price increments is captured by a mixture-of-experts model in log-odds space (Jacobs et al., [1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib34 "Adaptive mixtures of local experts"); Jordan and Jacobs, [1994](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib35 "Hierarchical mixtures of experts and the EM algorithm")). The resulting likelihood class is deliberately mechanism-agnostic: it is not tied to a particular market microstructure (automated market maker, limit-order book, call auction) and instead describes the conditional distribution of log-odds increments given volume and outcome. This choice permits inference from the minimal information set that is often available in practice, while still allowing principled uncertainty quantification, identifiability analysis, and stability diagnostics.

#### 1.1 Contributions

The inverse-problem perspective yields three primary benefits:

###### Principled uncertainty quantification.

It separates the inferential target YY from the nuisance structure that shapes the observations and provides a coherent Bayesian posterior ℙ​(Y=1∣HT)\mathbb{P}(Y=1\mid H\_{T}) with quantified sensitivity to modeling choices. We derive posterior concentration and finite-sample bounds on posterior error probability that decay exponentially in a KL-projection gap characterizing the distinguishability of outcomes after optimizing over nuisance structure (Theorem [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem3 "Theorem 4.3 (Posterior consistency for the outcome). ‣ 4.4.3 Posterior Consistency ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"), Proposition [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmproposition2 "Proposition 4.2 (Finite-sample posterior error bound (robust form)). ‣ 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")).

###### Explicit identifiability and well-posedness criteria.

Inverse problems are ill-posed when distinct latent states induce nearly indistinguishable observation laws or when small perturbations of the observations lead to large changes in the inferred state. By translating these notions into the language of price–volume histories, we obtain conditions under which the outcome is identifiable and posterior odds are stable (Section [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.SS1 "4.1 Induced Data Laws and KL Projections ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")), as well as conditions under which inference is fundamentally ambiguous due to type-composition confounding or outcome–nuisance symmetries.

###### Information-theoretic metrics.

We define realized information gain as the KL divergence between the posterior and prior on YY, and expected information gain as a mutual-information functional, thereby quantifying the extent to which the market history functions as an informative measurement of the outcome (Section [4.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.SS6 "4.6 Information Gain and Market-as-Sensor Metrics ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")). These metrics enable principled comparison of market designs and participation regimes.

#### 1.2 Paper Organization

To reduce fragmentation without changing scope, we organize the technical core into two main blocks. Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S2 "2 Background and Related Work ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") reviews related work. Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3 "3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") introduces the observation space, the log-odds representation, the latent-type likelihood class, and the Bayesian posterior. Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4 "4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") develops the inverse-problem analysis: identifiability via KL projections, posterior concentration and finite-sample bounds, stability under perturbations, and information-gain functionals. Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S5 "5 Computation and Empirical Validation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") presents computational methods and empirical validation on synthetic and real market data. Section [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S6 "6 Discussion ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") concludes with limitations and extensions.

### 2 Background and Related Work

Our work connects several distinct literatures: prediction market theory and information aggregation, market microstructure models of informed trading, Bayesian inverse problems and posterior consistency, and mixture-of-experts models in machine learning.

#### 2.1 Prediction Markets and Information Aggregation

The theoretical foundations of prediction markets rest on the idea that market prices aggregate dispersed private information (Hayek, [1945](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib20 "The use of knowledge in society")). Hanson ([2003](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib4 "Combinatorial information market design"), [2007](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib5 "Logarithmic market scoring rules for modular combinatorial information aggregation")) introduced the logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR), which provides bounded loss market making and connects prediction markets to proper scoring rules (Gneiting and Raftery, [2007](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib41 "Strictly proper scoring rules, prediction, and estimation"); Savage, [1971](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib42 "Elicitation of personal probabilities and expectations")). Chen and Pennock ([2007](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib6 "A utility framework for bounded-loss market makers")) analyzed the relationship between market scoring rules and cost functions, establishing equivalences that underpin modern automated market makers.

The question of whether prediction markets actually achieve efficient information aggregation has received substantial attention. Wolfers and Zitzewitz ([2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib2 "Prediction markets")) provided early evidence that prediction market prices track event probabilities well on average, while Manski ([2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib3 "Interpreting the predictions of prediction markets")) cautioned that market prices confound beliefs with risk preferences, questioning the interpretation of prices as probabilities. Ottaviani and Sørensen ([2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib10 "Price reaction to information with heterogeneous beliefs and wealth effects: underreaction, momentum, and reversal")) showed that even with risk-neutral traders, strategic behavior can prevent full information revelation. Ostrovsky ([2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib7 "Information aggregation in dynamic markets with strategic traders")) identified conditions under which repeated trading leads to information aggregation, while Iyer et al. ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib8 "Information aggregation and allocative efficiency in smooth markets")) studied aggregation in combinatorial markets.

Our framework complements this literature by taking an *inferential* rather than *equilibrium* perspective: we ask what can be learned about the outcome from the market history, treating participant behavior as latent structure to be marginalized rather than strategically modeled.

#### 2.2 Market Microstructure and Informed Trading

The market microstructure literature provides structural models of how private information affects prices. The seminal Kyle ([1985](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib12 "Continuous auctions and insider trading")) model describes a single informed trader, market makers, and noise traders, showing that price impact is linear in order flow and that the informed trader’s private information is gradually incorporated into prices. Glosten and Milgrom ([1985](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib13 "Bid, ask and transaction prices in a specialist market with heterogeneously informed traders")) introduced a sequential trade model where bid-ask spreads arise from adverse selection against informed traders.

The probability of informed trading (PIN) model of Easley et al. ([1996](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib14 "Liquidity, information, and infrequently traded stocks"), [2002](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib15 "Is information risk a determinant of asset returns?")) decomposes order flow into informed and uninformed components, enabling estimation of information asymmetry from trade data. Extensions include time-varying arrival rates (Easley et al., [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib16 "Time-varying arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades")) and high-frequency adaptations (Easley et al., [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib17 "Flow toxicity and liquidity in a high-frequency world")). Back et al. ([2000](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib18 "Imperfect competition among informed traders")) and Back and Baruch ([2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib19 "Information in securities markets: Kyle meets Glosten and Milgrom")) extended Kyle’s framework to multiple informed traders and different information structures.

Our latent-type mixture model can be viewed as a reduced-form representation of these structural models. The key distinction is that we do not require order-level data or specific assumptions about strategic behavior; instead, we model the aggregate effect of different trader populations on price increments conditional on volume.

#### 2.3 Bayesian Inverse Problems

The Bayesian approach to inverse problems treats unknown quantities as random variables and uses observed data to update prior beliefs (Stuart, [2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib21 "Inverse problems: a Bayesian perspective"); Kaipio and Somersalo, [2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib22 "Statistical and computational inverse problems")). Well-posedness in this framework requires that posteriors exist, are unique, and depend continuously on data (Dashti and Stuart, [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib23 "The Bayesian approach to inverse problems"); Latz, [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib24 "On the well-posedness of Bayesian inverse problems"); Madrigal-Cianci, [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib25 "Hierarchical Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian inverse problems")). Posterior consistency (i.e., convergence of the posterior to the true parameter as data accumulate-) has been extensively studied (Ghosal et al., [2000](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib26 "Convergence rates of posterior distributions"); Ghosal and Van der Vaart, [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib27 "Fundamentals of nonparametric Bayesian inference"); Van der Vaart and Van Zanten, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib28 "Rates of contraction of posterior distributions based on Gaussian process priors")).

For parametric models, the classical Bernstein–von Mises theorem establishes that posteriors concentrate around the maximum likelihood estimator at rate n−1/2n^{-1/2} and become asymptotically normal (Van der Vaart, [2000](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib29 "Asymptotic statistics")). For model selection and hypothesis testing, Bayes factors provide a coherent framework for comparing models with different nuisance structures (Kass and Raftery, [1995](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib30 "Bayes factors")). Walker ([2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib31 "New approaches to Bayesian consistency")) developed general posterior convergence rate theory based on testing conditions, which we adapt to our setting.

Our contribution is to instantiate this general framework for the specific structure of prediction market inference, where the “inverse problem” is recovering a binary outcome from price–volume histories mediated by latent trader types.

#### 2.4 Mixture Models and Mixture of Experts

Mixture models provide a flexible framework for modeling heterogeneous populations (McLachlan and Peel, [2000](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib32 "Finite mixture models"); Frühwirth-Schnatter, [2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib33 "Finite mixture and Markov switching models")). The mixture-of-experts architecture (Jacobs et al., [1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib34 "Adaptive mixtures of local experts"); Jordan and Jacobs, [1994](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib35 "Hierarchical mixtures of experts and the EM algorithm")) extends this by allowing mixture weights to depend on input features through a gating network. This architecture has seen renewed interest in large-scale machine learning (Shazeer et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib36 "Outrageously large neural networks: the sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts layer"); Fedus et al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib37 "Switch transformers: scaling to trillion parameter models with simple and efficient sparsity")).

Identifiability of finite mixtures is a classical concern (Teicher, [1963](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib38 "Identifiability of finite mixtures"); Yakowitz and Spragins, [1968](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib39 "On the identifiability of finite mixtures")). Location-scale mixtures are generally identifiable under mild conditions (Holzmann et al., [2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib40 "Identifiability of finite mixtures of elliptical distributions")), but identifiability can fail when components overlap substantially or when the number of components is misspecified. In our setting, identifiability of the *outcome* YY is primary, with mixture components serving as nuisance structure; this shifts the identifiability analysis from component recovery to outcome distinguishability.

#### 2.5 Learning from Strategic Data

A growing literature in machine learning addresses learning from data generated by strategic agents (Hardt et al., [2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib45 "Strategic classification"); Perdomo et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib46 "Performative prediction")). In online learning, adversarial bandits and experts settings study learning when data may be adversarially generated (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, [2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib47 "Prediction, learning, and games"); Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi, [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib48 "Regret analysis of stochastic and nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problems")). Mechanism design approaches seek to incentivize truthful reporting (Chen et al., [2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib43 "Information markets vs. opinion pools: an empirical comparison"); Lambert et al., [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib44 "Self-financed wagering mechanisms for forecasting")).

Our framework relates to this literature through the latent-type structure: adversarial or manipulative traders correspond to types whose increment distributions do not depend on the true outcome (or actively oppose it). The KL-projection gap condition for identifiability can be interpreted as requiring that informative types have sufficient weight to overcome noise and manipulation.

### 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation

#### 3.1 Outcome and Observed History

Fix a time horizon T∈ℕT\in\mathbb{N}. The unknown event outcome is a Bernoulli random variable

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Y∈𝒴:={0,1},ℙ​(Y=1)=π0∈(0,1).Y\in\mathcal{Y}:=\{0,1\},\qquad\mathbb{P}(Y=1)=\pi\_{0}\in(0,1). |  |

The analyst observes a price–volume history

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | HT:=((Pt,Vt))t=0T,H\_{T}:=\bigl((P\_{t},V\_{t})\bigr)\_{t=0}^{T}, |  |

where Pt∈(0,1)P\_{t}\in(0,1) is a market-implied probability at time tt and Vt∈[0,∞)V\_{t}\in[0,\infty) is the traded volume in the interval (t−1,t](t-1,t] for t≥1t\geq 1. We include P0∈(0,1)P\_{0}\in(0,1) as an initial market state and do not define V0V\_{0}. The associated measurable spaces are

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝒫:=(0,1)T+1,𝒱:=[0,∞)T,ℋ:=𝒫×𝒱,\mathcal{P}:=(0,1)^{T+1},\qquad\mathcal{V}:=[0,\infty)^{T},\qquad\mathcal{H}:=\mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{V}, |  |

each endowed with the product Borel σ\sigma-algebra. We write an element of ℋ\mathcal{H} as h=(p0:T,v1:T)h=(p\_{0:T},v\_{1:T}).

###### Remark 3.1 (Volume as design).

The present paper takes the volume sequence v1:Tv\_{1:T} as part of the observation, but does not require an explicit generative model for it. In many empirical settings, modeling volume is valuable, but treating v1:Tv\_{1:T} as a realized design sequence yields an analytically clean starting point and allows one to interpret volume as an endogenous “measurement intensity” chosen by participants. When needed, a generative model for V1:TV\_{1:T} can be added without changing the inferential target; see Section [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S6 "6 Discussion ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") for extensions.

#### 3.2 Log-Odds Coordinates

Define the logit map logit:(0,1)→ℝ\mathrm{logit}:(0,1)\to\mathbb{R} by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | logit​(p):=log⁡p1−p,\mathrm{logit}(p):=\log\frac{p}{1-p}, |  |

and its inverse, the logistic map σ:ℝ→(0,1)\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to(0,1), by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | σ​(x):=11+e−x.\sigma(x):=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}. |  |

We define the log-odds process Xt:=logit​(Pt)X\_{t}:=\mathrm{logit}(P\_{t}) and its increments Δ​Xt:=Xt−Xt−1\Delta X\_{t}:=X\_{t}-X\_{t-1} for t≥1t\geq 1. Given an observed history h=(p0:T,v1:T)h=(p\_{0:T},v\_{1:T}), the corresponding log-odds history is x0:T=logit​(p0:T)x\_{0:T}=\mathrm{logit}(p\_{0:T}) and increments Δ​x1:T\Delta x\_{1:T}.

Working in log-odds space is natural for several reasons:

1. 1.

   Additivity of evidence: Under conditional independence, log-likelihood ratios (and hence log-odds updates) are additive, making the log-odds representation natural for sequential Bayesian updating.
2. 2.

   Unbounded support: The log-odds transformation maps (0,1)(0,1) to ℝ\mathbb{R}, avoiding boundary behavior near 0 and 11 and permitting Gaussian and other unbounded noise models.
3. 3.

   Microstructure compatibility: Many market microstructure models describe price changes as approximately additive in log-odds (or log-prices) under small moves (Kyle, [1985](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib12 "Continuous auctions and insider trading"); Back et al., [2000](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib18 "Imperfect competition among informed traders")).

#### 3.3 Latent Types as Nuisance Structure

We introduce a finite set of latent types {1,…,K}\{1,\dots,K\}, where K∈ℕK\in\mathbb{N} is fixed. Types are not required to correspond to individual agents; rather, they represent latent behavioral regimes whose aggregate effect on price increments can be described probabilistically. This is a standard abstraction in mixture modeling (McLachlan and Peel, [2000](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib32 "Finite mixture models")) and is particularly appropriate when the analyst observes only aggregated market outcomes rather than identity-level order flow.

The nuisance parameter 𝚯\bm{\Theta} collects the quantities that govern type prevalence, type activation as a function of volume, and type-specific increment laws. We define:

1. 1.

   A vector of base mixture weights 𝝎=(ω1,…,ωK)\bm{\omega}=(\omega\_{1},\dots,\omega\_{K}) in the simplex

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | ΔK−1:={𝝎∈[0,1]K:∑k=1Kωk=1}.\Delta^{K-1}:=\Bigl\{\bm{\omega}\in[0,1]^{K}:\sum\_{k=1}^{K}\omega\_{k}=1\Bigr\}. |  |
2. 2.

   Gating parameters 𝜸∈Γ\bm{\gamma}\in\Gamma, where Γ⊆ℝdγ\Gamma\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d\_{\gamma}} is a compact parameter space, used to define volume-dependent participation weights.
3. 3.

   Type-specific parameters 𝜽k∈Θk\bm{\theta}\_{k}\in\Theta\_{k}, where each Θk⊆ℝdk\Theta\_{k}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d\_{k}} is a compact parameter space.

We write 𝚯:=(𝝎,𝜸,𝜽1:K)\bm{\Theta}:=(\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma},\bm{\theta}\_{1:K}) and Θ:=ΔK−1×Γ×Θ1×⋯×ΘK\Theta:=\Delta^{K-1}\times\Gamma\times\Theta\_{1}\times\cdots\times\Theta\_{K} for the global parameter space.

#### 3.4 Volume-Dependent Gating

Let ρk:[0,∞)×ΔK−1×Γ→[0,1]\rho\_{k}:[0,\infty)\times\Delta^{K-1}\times\Gamma\to[0,1] be measurable functions satisfying, for all v≥0v\geq 0,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ∑k=1Kρk​(v;𝝎,𝜸)=1.\sum\_{k=1}^{K}\rho\_{k}(v;\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma})=1. |  |

We interpret ρk​(v;𝝎,𝜸)\rho\_{k}(v;\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma}) as the probability that, at volume level vv, the effective price increment is generated by type kk. This formulation allows the active composition of market participants to change with market activity while maintaining a parsimonious parameterization through (𝝎,𝜸)(\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma}).

A canonical choice is a softmax gate:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ρk​(v;𝝎,𝜸)=ωk​exp⁡(ak​(v;𝜸))∑j=1Kωj​exp⁡(aj​(v;𝜸)),\rho\_{k}(v;\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma})=\frac{\omega\_{k}\exp(a\_{k}(v;\bm{\gamma}))}{\sum\_{j=1}^{K}\omega\_{j}\exp(a\_{j}(v;\bm{\gamma}))}, |  | (1) |

where ak:[0,∞)×Γ→ℝa\_{k}:[0,\infty)\times\Gamma\to\mathbb{R} is a gating *logit* function (renamed to avoid collision with the noise density gkg\_{k} below). Natural choices include:

* •

  Volume-linear: ak​(v;𝜸)=γk,0+γk,1​va\_{k}(v;\bm{\gamma})=\gamma\_{k,0}+\gamma\_{k,1}v
* •

  Log-volume: ak​(v;𝜸)=γk,0+γk,1​log⁡(1+v)a\_{k}(v;\bm{\gamma})=\gamma\_{k,0}+\gamma\_{k,1}\log(1+v)

These parameterizations capture the empirical regularity that informed traders may be more active during high-volume periods (Easley et al., [1996](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib14 "Liquidity, information, and infrequently traded stocks")), while noise traders may dominate low-volume periods.

#### 3.5 Type-Specific Increment Laws

For each type k∈{1,…,K}k\in\{1,\dots,K\} and outcome y∈{0,1}y\in\{0,1\}, we define a conditional density fk,y(⋅∣v,𝜽k)f\_{k,y}(\cdot\mid v,\bm{\theta}\_{k}) on ℝ\mathbb{R} with respect to Lebesgue measure. We assume a location–scale representation

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Δ​X=mk,y​(v;𝜽k)+sk​(v;𝜽k)​ε,ε∼Gk,\Delta X=m\_{k,y}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k})+s\_{k}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k})\,\varepsilon,\qquad\varepsilon\sim G\_{k}, |  | (2) |

where mk,y:[0,∞)×Θk→ℝm\_{k,y}:[0,\infty)\times\Theta\_{k}\to\mathbb{R} is a measurable location function, sk:[0,∞)×Θk→(0,∞)s\_{k}:[0,\infty)\times\Theta\_{k}\to(0,\infty) is a measurable scale function, and GkG\_{k} is a base noise distribution on ℝ\mathbb{R} with density gkg\_{k}. Under ([2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.E2 "In 3.5 Type-Specific Increment Laws ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | fk,y​(δ​x∣v,𝜽k)=1sk​(v;𝜽k)​gk​(δ​x−mk,y​(v;𝜽k)sk​(v;𝜽k)).f\_{k,y}(\delta x\mid v,\bm{\theta}\_{k})=\frac{1}{s\_{k}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k})}\,g\_{k}\!\left(\frac{\delta x-m\_{k,y}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k})}{s\_{k}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k})}\right). |  |

The dependence on yy is absorbed into mk,ym\_{k,y}, which is the reduced-form object encoding how truth influences directional drift in log-odds increments conditional on volume.

###### Definition 3.1 (Trader type taxonomy).

Given type parameters 𝛉k\bm{\theta}\_{k}, we classify type kk as:

1. 1.

   Informed if mk,1​(v;𝜽k)>mk,0​(v;𝜽k)m\_{k,1}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k})>m\_{k,0}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k}) on a relevant volume range (prices drift toward truth).
2. 2.

   Uninformed/Noise if mk,1​(v;𝜽k)=mk,0​(v;𝜽k)m\_{k,1}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k})=m\_{k,0}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k}) (increments are outcome-independent).
3. 3.

   Adversarial/Manipulative if mk,1​(v;𝜽k)<mk,0​(v;𝜽k)m\_{k,1}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k})<m\_{k,0}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{k}) (prices drift away from truth).

#### 3.6 Mixture Likelihood and Conditional Independence

Given the nuisance parameter 𝚯\bm{\Theta}, the outcome Y=yY=y, and a realized volume Vt=vV\_{t}=v, we model the increment Δ​Xt\Delta X\_{t} as having density

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | fy​(δ​x∣v,𝚯):=∑k=1Kρk​(v;𝝎,𝜸)​fk,y​(δ​x∣v,𝜽k).f\_{y}(\delta x\mid v,\bm{\Theta}):=\sum\_{k=1}^{K}\rho\_{k}(v;\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma})\,f\_{k,y}(\delta x\mid v,\bm{\theta}\_{k}). |  | (3) |

Let Δ​X1:T=(Δ​X1,…,Δ​XT)\Delta X\_{1:T}=(\Delta X\_{1},\dots,\Delta X\_{T}) and V1:T=(V1,…,VT)V\_{1:T}=(V\_{1},\dots,V\_{T}). The central simplifying assumption is conditional independence.

###### Assumption 3.1 (Conditional independence of increments).

Conditional on YY, 𝚯\bm{\Theta}, and V1:TV\_{1:T}, the increments Δ​Xt\Delta X\_{t} are independent with the time-inhomogeneous product density:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | p​(Δ​x1:T∣v1:T,Y=y,𝚯)=∏t=1Tfy​(Δ​xt∣vt,𝚯).p(\Delta x\_{1:T}\mid v\_{1:T},Y=y,\bm{\Theta})=\prod\_{t=1}^{T}f\_{y}(\Delta x\_{t}\mid v\_{t},\bm{\Theta}). |  | (4) |

This assumption can be relaxed to allow Markovian dependence or self-exciting volatility; see Section [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S6 "6 Discussion ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") for extensions.

#### 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model

To ground the abstract framework, we present a fully specified model that satisfies our assumptions and admits efficient computation. We explicitly impose an *orientation constraint* on drift magnitudes to eliminate the otherwise unavoidable outcome–nuisance sign symmetry.

###### Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model).

Consider K=3K=3 types representing informed traders, noise traders, and manipulators. Let μ1,μ3≥0\mu\_{1},\mu\_{3}\geq 0 be drift magnitudes (orientation constraint) and let λ1,κ1,σ1,σ2,σ3>0\lambda\_{1},\kappa\_{1},\sigma\_{1},\sigma\_{2},\sigma\_{3}>0, τ3≥0\tau\_{3}\geq 0.

Type 1 (Informed):

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | m1,y​(v;𝜽1)\displaystyle m\_{1,y}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{1}) | =μ1​(2​y−1)⋅(1−e−λ1​v),\displaystyle=\mu\_{1}(2y-1)\cdot(1-e^{-\lambda\_{1}v}), |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | s1​(v;𝜽1)\displaystyle s\_{1}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{1}) | =σ1/1+κ1​v,\displaystyle=\sigma\_{1}/\sqrt{1+\kappa\_{1}v}, |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | G1\displaystyle G\_{1} | =𝒩​(0,1).\displaystyle=\mathcal{N}(0,1). |  |

The drift μ1​(2​y−1)\mu\_{1}(2y-1) pushes prices toward the truth (y=1y=1 implies positive drift), with magnitude increasing in volume at rate λ1\lambda\_{1}. Scale decreases with volume, reflecting improved price efficiency.

Type 2 (Noise):

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | m2,y​(v;𝜽2)\displaystyle m\_{2,y}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{2}) | =0(outcome-independent),\displaystyle=0\quad\text{(outcome-independent)}, |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | s2​(v;𝜽2)\displaystyle s\_{2}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{2}) | =σ2,\displaystyle=\sigma\_{2}, |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | G2\displaystyle G\_{2} | =𝒩​(0,1).\displaystyle=\mathcal{N}(0,1). |  |

Type 3 (Manipulator):

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | m3,y​(v;𝜽3)\displaystyle m\_{3,y}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{3}) | =−μ3​(2​y−1)⋅𝟙​{v>τ3},\displaystyle=-\mu\_{3}(2y-1)\cdot\mathbbm{1}\{v>\tau\_{3}\}, |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | s3​(v;𝜽3)\displaystyle s\_{3}(v;\bm{\theta}\_{3}) | =σ3,\displaystyle=\sigma\_{3}, |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | G3\displaystyle G\_{3} | =tν(Student-​t​ with ​ν​ degrees of freedom).\displaystyle=t\_{\nu}\quad\text{(Student-}t\text{ with }\nu\text{ degrees of freedom)}. |  |

Gating: Use the general gating family ρk\rho\_{k}. A convenient instantiation is the softmax gate ([1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.E1 "In 3.4 Volume-Dependent Gating ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")) with log-volume logits

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ak​(v;𝜸)=γk,0+γk,1​log⁡(1+v),a\_{k}(v;\bm{\gamma})=\gamma\_{k,0}+\gamma\_{k,1}\log(1+v), |  |

optionally combined with hard participation constraints such as ρ3​(v;𝛚,𝛄)=0\rho\_{3}(v;\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma})=0 for v≤τ3v\leq\tau\_{3} when one wants a strict “activation” regime for manipulation (useful for theoretical separation arguments; empirically, this can be approximated by very negative logits below τ3\tau\_{3}).

The full parameter vector is:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝜽=(𝝎,𝜸,μ1,λ1,σ1,κ1,σ2,μ3,τ3,σ3,ν).\bm{\theta}=(\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma},\mu\_{1},\lambda\_{1},\sigma\_{1},\kappa\_{1},\sigma\_{2},\mu\_{3},\tau\_{3},\sigma\_{3},\nu). |  |

###### Remark 3.2 (Orientation and outcome–nuisance symmetries).

Without sign restrictions (e.g. allowing μ1<0\mu\_{1}<0), the mapping (y,μ1)↦(1−y,−μ1)(y,\mu\_{1})\mapsto(1-y,-\mu\_{1}) can render outcome inference non-identifiable, since the conditional increment law may be reproduced under the wrong outcome by a sign flip in nuisance parameters. We therefore treat the orientation constraint μ1,μ3≥0\mu\_{1},\mu\_{3}\geq 0 as part of the model specification.

#### 3.8 Prior and Posterior

We place a prior Π\Pi on 𝚯\bm{\Theta}. A convenient factorization is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝝎∼Dirichlet​(α1,…,αK),𝜸∼ΠΓ,𝜽k∼Πk​ independently for ​k=1,…,K.\bm{\omega}\sim\mathrm{Dirichlet}(\alpha\_{1},\dots,\alpha\_{K}),\qquad\bm{\gamma}\sim\Pi\_{\Gamma},\qquad\bm{\theta}\_{k}\sim\Pi\_{k}\ \text{ independently for }k=1,\dots,K. |  |

Given an observed history h=(p0:T,v1:T)h=(p\_{0:T},v\_{1:T}), let Δ​x1:T\Delta x\_{1:T} be the implied log-odds increments. The joint posterior on (Y,𝚯)(Y,\bm{\Theta}) is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℙ​(Y=y,𝚯∈d​θ∣h)∝π0y​(1−π0)1−y​p​(Δ​x1:T∣v1:T,Y=y,θ)​Π​(d​θ).\mathbb{P}(Y=y,\bm{\Theta}\in d\theta\mid h)\propto\pi\_{0}^{y}(1-\pi\_{0})^{1-y}\,p(\Delta x\_{1:T}\mid v\_{1:T},Y=y,\theta)\,\Pi(d\theta). |  |

The marginal posterior on the outcome is

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℙ​(Y=1∣h)=π0​m1​(h)π0​m1​(h)+(1−π0)​m0​(h),\mathbb{P}(Y=1\mid h)=\frac{\pi\_{0}\,m\_{1}(h)}{\pi\_{0}\,m\_{1}(h)+(1-\pi\_{0})\,m\_{0}(h)}, |  | (5) |

where the marginal likelihood under outcome yy is

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | my​(h):=∫Θp​(Δ​x1:T∣v1:T,Y=y,θ)​Π​(d​θ).m\_{y}(h):=\int\_{\Theta}p(\Delta x\_{1:T}\mid v\_{1:T},Y=y,\theta)\,\Pi(d\theta). |  | (6) |

Define the Bayes factor

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | BFT​(h):=m1​(h)m0​(h).\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h):=\frac{m\_{1}(h)}{m\_{0}(h)}. |  |

Then the posterior odds admit the closed form

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | log⁡ℙ​(Y=1∣h)ℙ​(Y=0∣h)=log⁡π01−π0+log⁡BFT​(h).\log\frac{\mathbb{P}(Y=1\mid h)}{\mathbb{P}(Y=0\mid h)}=\log\frac{\pi\_{0}}{1-\pi\_{0}}+\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h). |  | (7) |

Equation ([7](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.E7 "In 3.8 Prior and Posterior ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")) makes explicit that inference on YY reduces to understanding the marginal Bayes factor induced by the price–volume history after integrating out latent type structure.

### 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain

#### 4.1 Induced Data Laws and KL Projections

Fix a deterministic volume design v1:T∈𝒱v\_{1:T}\in\mathcal{V}. For each outcome y∈{0,1}y\in\{0,1\} and nuisance parameter θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta, let Py,θ(T)P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)} denote the probability measure on (ℝT,ℬ​(ℝT))(\mathbb{R}^{T},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^{T})) with density

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | δ​x1:T↦∏t=1Tfy​(δ​xt∣vt,θ).\delta x\_{1:T}\mapsto\prod\_{t=1}^{T}f\_{y}(\delta x\_{t}\mid v\_{t},\theta). |  |

We interpret Py,θ(T)P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)} as the induced law of log-odds increments conditional on the realized volume sequence.

For θ,θ′∈Θ\theta,\theta^{\prime}\in\Theta and y,y′∈{0,1}y,y^{\prime}\in\{0,1\}, define the finite-horizon KL divergence

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | DKL(Py,θ(T)∥Py′,θ′(T)):=𝔼Py,θ(T)[logpy,θ(T)​(Δ​X1:T)py′,θ′(T)​(Δ​X1:T)],\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{y^{\prime},\theta^{\prime}}^{(T)}\right):=\mathbb{E}\_{P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)}}\!\left[\log\frac{p\_{y,\theta}^{(T)}(\Delta X\_{1:T})}{p\_{y^{\prime},\theta^{\prime}}^{(T)}(\Delta X\_{1:T})}\right], |  |

where py,θ(T)p\_{y,\theta}^{(T)} denotes the corresponding density. Under Assumption [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmassumption1 "Assumption 3.1 (Conditional independence of increments). ‣ 3.6 Mixture Likelihood and Conditional Independence ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"), this divergence decomposes as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | DKL(Py,θ(T)∥Py′,θ′(T))=∑t=1TDKL(fy(⋅∣vt,θ)∥fy′(⋅∣vt,θ′)).\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{y^{\prime},\theta^{\prime}}^{(T)}\right)=\sum\_{t=1}^{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(f\_{y}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)\,\middle\|\,f\_{y^{\prime}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\prime})\right). |  | (8) |

Because the nuisance parameter is unknown, the relevant separation notion is a *projection gap* between the outcome-indexed families after optimizing over nuisance structure.

###### Definition 4.1 (KL projection gap).

Fix (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) and v1:Tv\_{1:T}. For y∈{0,1}y\in\{0,1\}, define the (normalized) KL projection

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | KT(y⋆,θ⋆→y):=infθ∈Θ1TDKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥Py,θ(T)).K\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}\to y):=\inf\_{\theta\in\Theta}\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)}\right). |  | (9) |

The *outcome-separation gap* is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | δT​(y⋆,θ⋆):=KT​(y⋆,θ⋆→1−y⋆).\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}):=K\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}\to 1-y^{\star}). |  |

###### Definition 4.2 (Outcome identifiability (at the truth)).

Fix (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) and v1:Tv\_{1:T}. The outcome is *identifiable at horizon TT at (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})* if δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)>0\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})>0. If additionally the reverse-direction projection KT​(1−y⋆,θ→y⋆)K\_{T}(1-y^{\star},\theta\to y^{\star}) is bounded away from zero uniformly over θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta, we say the model class exhibits *two-sided* outcome separation.

###### Remark 4.1 (Uniform vs. truth-relative identifiability).

Demanding δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)>0\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})>0 for *every* θ⋆∈Θ\theta^{\star}\in\Theta is typically too strong in latent-type models, since Θ\Theta often includes regimes in which all active types are outcome-independent (e.g. ρk\rho\_{k} concentrates on noise types). Our definition isolates the statistically meaningful question: whether the realized data-generating pair (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) is distinguishable from the alternative outcome family.

#### 4.2 Mechanisms of Non-Identifiability

The latent-type structure ([3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.E3 "In 3.6 Mixture Likelihood and Conditional Independence ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")) highlights key sources of outcome non-identifiability.

###### Proposition 4.1 (Sufficient conditions for outcome non-identifiability).

Fix (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) and v1:Tv\_{1:T}. The separation gap satisfies δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)=0\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})=0 whenever any of the following hold:

1. 1.

   Type-composition confounding (uninformative regime): for each tt and each type kk with ρk​(vt;θ⋆)>0\rho\_{k}(v\_{t};\theta^{\star})>0, one has fk,1(⋅∣vt,𝜽k⋆)=fk,0(⋅∣vt,𝜽k⋆)f\_{k,1}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\bm{\theta}\_{k}^{\star})=f\_{k,0}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\bm{\theta}\_{k}^{\star}). In particular, if f1(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)=f0(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)f\_{1}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star})=f\_{0}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star}) for all tt, then the two outcomes induce the same law and are indistinguishable.
2. 2.

   Outcome–nuisance symmetry: there exists a measurable map Ψ:Θ→Θ\Psi:\Theta\to\Theta such that for all tt,

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | f1(⋅∣vt,θ)=f0(⋅∣vt,Ψ(θ))as densities on ℝ.f\_{1}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)=f\_{0}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\Psi(\theta))\quad\text{as densities on }\mathbb{R}. |  |

   Then infθDKL​(P1,θ(T)∥P0,θ′(T))=0\inf\_{\theta}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(P\_{1,\theta}^{(T)}\|P\_{0,\theta^{\prime}}^{(T)})=0 and vice versa. This is the symmetry eliminated by the orientation constraint in Example [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmexample1 "Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model). ‣ 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types").
3. 3.

   Adversarial mimicry: there exists θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta such that Py⋆,θ⋆(T)=P1−y⋆,θ(T)P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}=P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)}. This includes degenerate cases where adversarial components perfectly cancel informed drift on the observed volume range.

###### Proof.

If Py⋆,θ⋆(T)=P1−y⋆,θ(T)P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}=P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)} for some θ\theta, then δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)=0\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})=0 by Definition [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmdefinition1 "Definition 4.1 (KL projection gap). ‣ 4.1 Induced Data Laws and KL Projections ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"). Items (1)–(2) provide explicit sufficient conditions for such equality.
∎

#### 4.3 Sufficient Conditions for Separation in the Gaussian Model

The following result gives a robust (and checkable) route to a positive separation gap in Example [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmexample1 "Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model). ‣ 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"). The main idea is to identify a subset of times where (i) the outcome-dependent drift is activated, (ii) manipulation is inactive, and (iii) the remaining finite mixture is identifiable as a parametric family, so equality of laws under opposite outcomes is impossible.

###### Theorem 4.1 (A design-based sufficient condition for outcome separation).

Assume the Gaussian latent-type model of Example [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmexample1 "Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model). ‣ 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") with the orientation constraint μ1,μ3≥0\mu\_{1},\mu\_{3}\geq 0. Fix (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) and suppose there exists an index set IT⊂{1,…,T}I\_{T}\subset\{1,\dots,T\} and constants ρ¯,m¯,σ¯,σ¯>0\underline{\rho},\underline{m},\underline{\sigma},\overline{\sigma}>0 such that for all t∈ITt\in I\_{T}:

1. 1.

   Informed activation: ρ1​(vt;θ⋆)≥ρ¯\rho\_{1}(v\_{t};\theta^{\star})\geq\underline{\rho} and |m1,1​(vt;𝜽1⋆)−m1,0​(vt;𝜽1⋆)|≥m¯|m\_{1,1}(v\_{t};\bm{\theta}\_{1}^{\star})-m\_{1,0}(v\_{t};\bm{\theta}\_{1}^{\star})|\geq\underline{m}.
2. 2.

   Manipulator inactivity: m3,1​(vt;𝜽3)=m3,0​(vt;𝜽3)=0m\_{3,1}(v\_{t};\bm{\theta}\_{3})=m\_{3,0}(v\_{t};\bm{\theta}\_{3})=0 for all 𝜽3∈Θ3\bm{\theta}\_{3}\in\Theta\_{3} (e.g. vt≤τ3v\_{t}\leq\tau\_{3} and manipulator drift is thresholded as in Example [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmexample1 "Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model). ‣ 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")).
3. 3.

   Non-degeneracy of scales: for all θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta, the type-specific scales satisfy σ¯≤sk​(vt;𝜽k)≤σ¯\underline{\sigma}\leq s\_{k}(v\_{t};\bm{\theta}\_{k})\leq\overline{\sigma} for k∈{1,2}k\in\{1,2\}.

Then there exists κ>0\kappa>0 (depending on the constants above and on Θ\Theta) such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)≥|IT|T​κ.\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})\ \geq\ \frac{|I\_{T}|}{T}\,\kappa. |  |

In particular, if lim infT→∞|IT|/T>0\liminf\_{T\to\infty}|I\_{T}|/T>0, then lim infT→∞δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)>0\liminf\_{T\to\infty}\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})>0.

###### Proof sketch.

Fix t∈ITt\in I\_{T}. By item (2), the conditional increment law at volume vtv\_{t} reduces (uniformly over θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta) to a two-component Gaussian mixture in which the only outcome-dependent location shift occurs in the informed component. Under mild non-degeneracy (item (3)) and compactness of Θ\Theta, the family of such mixtures is identifiable up to label-switching (Teicher, [1963](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib38 "Identifiability of finite mixtures"); Holzmann et al., [2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib40 "Identifiability of finite mixtures of elliptical distributions")). The orientation constraint pins the sign of the informed drift under each outcome. Hence no choice of nuisance parameters under the wrong outcome can exactly reproduce the outcome-conditional density at vtv\_{t} generated by (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) when item (1) holds. Continuity of θ↦DKL(fy⋆(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)∥f1−y⋆(⋅∣vt,θ))\theta\mapsto\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(f\_{y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star})\|f\_{1-y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)) and compactness of Θ\Theta imply the infimum over θ\theta is achieved and strictly positive at each such tt; denote the minimum by κt>0\kappa\_{t}>0. Let κ:=mint∈IT⁡κt\kappa:=\min\_{t\in I\_{T}}\kappa\_{t}. Summing over t∈ITt\in I\_{T} using ([8](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.E8 "In 4.1 Induced Data Laws and KL Projections ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")) yields the claim.

###### Remark 4.2 (Interpretation).

Theorem [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem1 "Theorem 4.1 (A design-based sufficient condition for outcome separation). ‣ 4.3 Sufficient Conditions for Separation in the Gaussian Model ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") isolates a practically meaningful regime: a positive fraction of “clean” volume periods in which informative flow is present and adversarial drift is inactive suffices to render outcome inference well-posed, even when other periods are dominated by noise or heavy tails.

#### 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds

This section links posterior behavior to the KL projection gap. Because nuisance structure is integrated out, the key object is the marginal likelihood ratio.

##### 4.4.1 Regularity Conditions

We impose standard conditions ensuring measurability and allowing uniform laws of large numbers over Θ\Theta.

###### Assumption 4.1 (Compactness and continuity).

The parameter space Θ\Theta is a compact metric space, and for each tt, the map θ↦log⁡fy​(δ​x∣vt,θ)\theta\mapsto\log f\_{y}(\delta x\mid v\_{t},\theta) is continuous for Lebesgue-a.e. δ​x∈ℝ\delta x\in\mathbb{R}.

###### Assumption 4.2 (Envelope and integrability).

There exists a measurable envelope function M:ℝ→[0,∞)M:\mathbb{R}\to[0,\infty) such that for all tt, all θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta, and all δ​x∈ℝ\delta x\in\mathbb{R},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |logfy(δx∣vt,θ)|≤M(δx),\bigl|\log f\_{y}(\delta x\mid v\_{t},\theta)\bigr|\leq M(\delta x), |  |

and supt≤T𝔼Py⋆,θ⋆(T)​[M​(Δ​Xt)]<∞\sup\_{t\leq T}\mathbb{E}\_{P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}}[M(\Delta X\_{t})]<\infty for each TT.

###### Assumption 4.3 (KL support at (near) projections).

Fix (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) and v1:Tv\_{1:T}. For each y∈{0,1}y\in\{0,1\} and ϵ>0\epsilon>0, define the ϵ\epsilon-projection set

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Θy,T(ϵ):={θ∈Θ:1TDKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥Py,θ(T))≤KT(y⋆,θ⋆→y)+ϵ}.\Theta\_{y,T}(\epsilon):=\left\{\theta\in\Theta:\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)}\right)\leq K\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}\to y)+\epsilon\right\}. |  |

Assume Π​(Θy,T​(ϵ))>0\Pi(\Theta\_{y,T}(\epsilon))>0 for all yy and ϵ>0\epsilon>0 (for each fixed TT).

Assumption [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption3 "Assumption 4.3 (KL support at (near) projections). ‣ 4.4.1 Regularity Conditions ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") is the natural “KL support” condition: the prior must not exclude parameters that achieve (or nearly achieve) the best KL fit for each outcome hypothesis. Unlike uniform-in-TT lower bounds, this condition is compatible with shrinking neighborhoods of minimizers.

##### 4.4.2 Bayes Factor Separation

Write the log-likelihood under outcome yy as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℓy,T​(θ):=∑t=1Tlog⁡fy​(Δ​Xt∣vt,θ),my​(HT)=∫Θeℓy,T​(θ)​Π​(d​θ).\ell\_{y,T}(\theta):=\sum\_{t=1}^{T}\log f\_{y}(\Delta X\_{t}\mid v\_{t},\theta),\qquad m\_{y}(H\_{T})=\int\_{\Theta}e^{\ell\_{y,T}(\theta)}\,\Pi(d\theta). |  |

Under the true law Py⋆,θ⋆(T)P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}, define the (normalized) expected log-likelihood

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Λy,T​(θ):=1T​𝔼Py⋆,θ⋆(T)​[ℓy,T​(θ)].\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta):=\frac{1}{T}\mathbb{E}\_{P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}}[\ell\_{y,T}(\theta)]. |  |

Then for each yy and θ\theta,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Λy⋆,T(θ⋆)−Λy,T(θ)=1TDKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥Py,θ(T)).\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})-\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)=\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)}\right). |  |

###### Assumption 4.4 (Uniform law of large numbers).

For each y∈{0,1}y\in\{0,1\},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | supθ∈Θ|1T​ℓy,T​(θ)−Λy,T​(θ)|→0almost surely under ​Py⋆,θ⋆(T).\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}\left|\frac{1}{T}\ell\_{y,T}(\theta)-\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)\right|\to 0\qquad\text{almost surely under }P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}. |  |

###### Theorem 4.2 (Asymptotic separation of Bayes factors (robust form)).

Assume Assumptions [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmassumption1 "Assumption 3.1 (Conditional independence of increments). ‣ 3.6 Mixture Likelihood and Conditional Independence ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") and [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption1 "Assumption 4.1 (Compactness and continuity). ‣ 4.4.1 Regularity Conditions ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")–[4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption4 "Assumption 4.4 (Uniform law of large numbers). ‣ 4.4.2 Bayes Factor Separation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"). Fix (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) and v1:Tv\_{1:T}. Then for any ϵ>0\epsilon>0, almost surely for all sufficiently large TT,

|  | 1T​log⁡BFT​(HT)≥δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)−ϵ,\frac{1}{T}\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(H\_{T})\geq\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})-\epsilon, |  | (10) |

and similarly

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1T​log⁡BFT​(HT)≤δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)+ϵwhen ​y⋆=1,\frac{1}{T}\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(H\_{T})\leq\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})+\epsilon\qquad\text{when }y^{\star}=1, |  | (11) |

with the inequalities reversed when y⋆=0y^{\star}=0.
Consequently, if lim infT→∞δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)>0\liminf\_{T\to\infty}\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star})>0, then |log⁡BFT​(HT)||\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(H\_{T})| grows at least linearly with TT.

###### Proof sketch.

Under Assumption [4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption4 "Assumption 4.4 (Uniform law of large numbers). ‣ 4.4.2 Bayes Factor Separation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"), 1T​log⁡my​(HT)\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{y}(H\_{T}) concentrates around supθΛy,T​(θ)\sup\_{\theta}\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta) up to o​(1)o(1), by standard Laplace-principle bounds (upper bound by the supremum; lower bound by restricting the integral to any neighborhood with positive prior mass). The difference supθΛy⋆,T​(θ)−supθΛ1−y⋆,T​(θ)\sup\_{\theta}\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta)-\sup\_{\theta}\Lambda\_{1-y^{\star},T}(\theta) equals the KL projection gap δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) because Λy⋆,T\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T} is maximized at θ⋆\theta^{\star} and supθΛ1−y⋆,T​(θ)=Λy⋆,T​(θ⋆)−infθ1T​DKL​(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥P1−y⋆,θ(T))\sup\_{\theta}\Lambda\_{1-y^{\star},T}(\theta)=\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})-\inf\_{\theta}\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\|P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)}).

##### 4.4.3 Posterior Consistency

###### Theorem 4.3 (Posterior consistency for the outcome).

Assume the conditions of Theorem [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem2 "Theorem 4.2 (Asymptotic separation of Bayes factors (robust form)). ‣ 4.4.2 Bayes Factor Separation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"). If

∎

##### 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation

Uniform boundedness of log-likelihood ratios is incompatible with unbounded-support increment models (Gaussian, Student-tt, etc.). We therefore state finite-sample guarantees in a robust, truncation-based form.

###### Assumption 4.5 (Moment control for increments).

There exists q>2q>2 and Cq<∞C\_{q}<\infty such that supt≤T𝔼​[|Δ​Xt|q]≤Cq\sup\_{t\leq T}\mathbb{E}[|\Delta X\_{t}|^{q}]\leq C\_{q} under the true law Py⋆,θ⋆(T)P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)} (for each fixed TT).

For R>0R>0, define the “typical increment” event ER:={max1≤t≤T⁡|Δ​Xt|≤R}E\_{R}:=\{\max\_{1\leq t\leq T}|\Delta X\_{t}|\leq R\}.

Suppose Δ​X1:T∼Py⋆,θ⋆(T)\Delta X\_{1:T}\sim P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)} and Assumptions [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption3 "Assumption 4.3 (KL support at (near) projections). ‣ 4.4.1 Regularity Conditions ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") and [4.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption5 "Assumption 4.5 (Moment control for increments). ‣ 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") hold. Let δT:=δT​(y⋆,θ⋆)\delta\_{T}:=\delta\_{T}(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}). Then for any ϵ∈(0,δT)\epsilon\in(0,\delta\_{T}) and any R>0R>0,

###### Proof sketch.

On ERE\_{R}, the log-likelihood ratio increments are uniformly bounded by BRB\_{R}, so concentration for the (centered) log Bayes factor follows from Hoeffding/Azuma-type inequalities applied to independent increments. Outside ERE\_{R}, the bound is trivial and we pay ℙ​(ERc)\mathbb{P}(E\_{R}^{c}).

This section studies well-posedness of outcome inference as a map from observed histories to posterior beliefs.

##### 4.5.2 Local Lipschitz Regularity

Global Lipschitz bounds on log⁡fy​(⋅)\log f\_{y}(\cdot) are incompatible with Gaussian (and most other) increment models on ℝ\mathbb{R}. We therefore adopt a local form that holds on “typical” events.

###### Assumption 4.6 (Local Lipschitz regularity on bounded increments).

For each R>0R>0 there exist constants Lx​(R),Lv​(R)<∞L\_{x}(R),L\_{v}(R)<\infty such that for all y∈{0,1}y\in\{0,1\}, all θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta, all v,v′≥0v,v^{\prime}\geq 0, and all δ​x,δ​x′∈[−R,R]\delta x,\delta x^{\prime}\in[-R,R],

###### Remark 4.3 (Gaussian example).

For a Gaussian location-scale family, |∂xlog⁡f||\partial\_{x}\log f| grows at most linearly in |x||x|; hence Lx​(R)L\_{x}(R) can be taken of the form c0+c1​Rc\_{0}+c\_{1}R, uniformly over compact parameter sets. Analogous bounds hold for mixtures under mild non-degeneracy.

Instability can arise either from extreme price impact (large Lx​(R)L\_{x}(R)) or from strong volume sensitivity (large Lv​(R)L\_{v}(R)).

|  | IG(h):=DKL(Bern(πT(h))∥Bern(π0))=πT(h)logπT​(h)π0+(1−πT(h))log1−πT​(h)1−π0.\mathrm{IG}(h):=\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(\mathrm{Bern}(\pi\_{T}(h))\,\middle\|\,\mathrm{Bern}(\pi\_{0})\right)=\pi\_{T}(h)\log\frac{\pi\_{T}(h)}{\pi\_{0}}+(1-\pi\_{T}(h))\log\frac{1-\pi\_{T}(h)}{1-\pi\_{0}}. |  | (19) |

###### Proposition 4.3 (Properties of realized information gain).

The realized information gain satisfies:

1. 1.

   IG​(h)≥0\mathrm{IG}(h)\geq 0 with equality iff πT​(h)=π0\pi\_{T}(h)=\pi\_{0}.
2. 2.

   IG​(h)≤max⁡{log⁡(1/π0),log⁡(1/(1−π0))}\mathrm{IG}(h)\leq\max\{\log(1/\pi\_{0}),\log(1/(1-\pi\_{0}))\}, with equality approached as πT​(h)→1\pi\_{T}(h)\to 1 or πT​(h)→0\pi\_{T}(h)\to 0. In particular, when π0=1/2\pi\_{0}=1/2, IG​(h)≤log⁡2\mathrm{IG}(h)\leq\log 2.
3. 3.

   IG​(h)\mathrm{IG}(h) is a monotone function of |log⁡BFT​(h)||\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h)|.

##### 4.6.2 Expected Information Gain and Mutual Information

Because we treat v1:Tv\_{1:T} as a realized design, the natural expected information gain is conditional on that design.

###### Lemma 4.1 (Information gain identity (conditional on design)).

Fix v1:Tv\_{1:T} and let HT=(P0:T,V1:T)H\_{T}=(P\_{0:T},V\_{1:T}) with V1:T≡v1:TV\_{1:T}\equiv v\_{1:T}. Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼[IG(HT)∣V1:T=v1:T]=I(Y;ΔX1:T|V1:T=v1:T),\mathbb{E}\big[\mathrm{IG}(H\_{T})\mid V\_{1:T}=v\_{1:T}\big]=I\!\left(Y;\Delta X\_{1:T}\,\middle|\,V\_{1:T}=v\_{1:T}\right), |  |

where I(⋅;⋅∣⋅)I(\cdot;\cdot\mid\cdot) denotes conditional mutual information under the joint model induced by the prior on YY and the likelihood for Δ​X1:T\Delta X\_{1:T}.

###### Proof.

Mutual information admits the representation I(Y;Z∣W)=𝔼[DKL(p(Y∣Z,W)∥p(Y∣W))]I(Y;Z\mid W)=\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(p(Y\mid Z,W)\|p(Y\mid W))]. Here WW is the fixed design, and Z=Δ​X1:TZ=\Delta X\_{1:T}. For binary YY, the conditional posterior p​(Y∣Z,W)p(Y\mid Z,W) is Bernoulli with parameter πT​(HT)\pi\_{T}(H\_{T}), yielding the expected KL divergence ([19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.E19 "In 4.6.1 Realized Information Gain ‣ 4.6 Information Gain and Market-as-Sensor Metrics ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")).
∎

Since YY is a single bit, I​(Y;Δ​X1:T∣V1:T)≤H​(Y)I(Y;\Delta X\_{1:T}\mid V\_{1:T})\leq H(Y), where H​(Y)=−π0​log⁡π0−(1−π0)​log⁡(1−π0)H(Y)=-\pi\_{0}\log\pi\_{0}-(1-\pi\_{0})\log(1-\pi\_{0}). This bounds the *expected* information gain regardless of horizon—once the outcome is resolved, additional observations provide diminishing returns.

##### 4.6.3 Information Destruction by Type Composition

The latent-type structure affects information gain through the induced conditional densities. When uninformed or adversarial types dominate, the separation gap shrinks and both posterior concentration and information gain weaken.

###### Definition 4.3 (Effective informativeness).

The effective informativeness of a market at volume level vv is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | η​(v;θ):=∑k=1Kρk​(v;𝝎,𝜸)​sign​(mk,1​(v)−mk,0​(v))​|mk,1​(v)−mk,0​(v)|.\eta(v;\theta):=\sum\_{k=1}^{K}\rho\_{k}(v;\bm{\omega},\bm{\gamma})\,\mathrm{sign}\!\bigl(m\_{k,1}(v)-m\_{k,0}(v)\bigr)\,\bigl|m\_{k,1}(v)-m\_{k,0}(v)\bigr|. |  |

When η​(v;θ)>0\eta(v;\theta)>0, informed trading dominates and prices drift toward truth. When η​(v;θ)≈0\eta(v;\theta)\approx 0, the market is uninformative at volume vv. When η​(v;θ)<0\eta(v;\theta)<0, manipulation dominates.

### 5 Computation and Empirical Validation

Computing ℙ​(Y=1∣h)\mathbb{P}(Y=1\mid h) requires evaluating marginal likelihoods my​(h)m\_{y}(h) that integrate out nuisance parameters. We present two complementary approaches and validate the theory empirically.

#### 5.1 Computational Methods

##### 5.1.1 Sequential Monte Carlo

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) (Doucet et al., [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib49 "Sequential Monte Carlo methods in practice"); Chopin and Papaspiliopoulos, [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib50 "An introduction to sequential Monte Carlo")) provides a flexible framework for estimating marginal likelihoods in sequential models.

Algorithm 1  SMC for Marginal Likelihood Estimation

7:  Normalize: wt(i)=w~t(i)/∑jw~t(j)w\_{t}^{(i)}=\tilde{w}\_{t}^{(i)}/\sum\_{j}\tilde{w}\_{t}^{(j)}

8:  Compute ESS: ESS=1/∑i(wt(i))2\mathrm{ESS}=1/\sum\_{i}(w\_{t}^{(i)})^{2}

###### Proposition 5.1 (SMC consistency).

Under regularity conditions (Chopin, [2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib51 "Central limit theorem for sequential Monte Carlo methods and its application to Bayesian inference")), as N→∞N\to\infty:

for some asymptotic variance σy2\sigma\_{y}^{2}.

##### 5.1.2 Variational Inference

For large-scale applications, variational inference (Blei et al., [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#bib.bib52 "Variational inference: a review for statisticians")) provides a scalable alternative. We approximate the posterior Π​(θ∣h,y)\Pi(\theta\mid h,y) with a tractable family q​(θ;ϕ)q(\theta;\phi) by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO):

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℒ​(ϕ;y)=𝔼q​(θ;ϕ)​[log⁡p​(Δ​x1:T∣v1:T,y,θ)]−DKL​(q​(θ;ϕ)∥Π​(θ)).\mathcal{L}(\phi;y)=\mathbb{E}\_{q(\theta;\phi)}[\log p(\Delta x\_{1:T}\mid v\_{1:T},y,\theta)]-\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(q(\theta;\phi)\|\Pi(\theta)). |  | (20) |

The ELBO provides a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood: ℒ​(ϕ;y)≤log⁡my​(h)\mathcal{L}(\phi;y)\leq\log m\_{y}(h).

For the Gaussian model (Example [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmexample1 "Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model). ‣ 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")), we use a mean-field approximation:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | q​(θ;ϕ)=q​(𝝎;ϕω)​∏kq​(𝜽k;ϕk),q(\theta;\phi)=q(\bm{\omega};\phi\_{\omega})\prod\_{k}q(\bm{\theta}\_{k};\phi\_{k}), |  |

with Dirichlet variational distribution for 𝝎\bm{\omega} and Gaussian distributions for continuous parameters.

11:return Approximate log Bayes factor: ℒ1∗−ℒ0∗\mathcal{L}^{\*}\_{1}-\mathcal{L}^{\*}\_{0}

###### Remark 5.1 (ELBO difference is not a one-sided bound on log⁡BFT\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}).

While ℒ​(ϕ;y)≤log⁡my​(h)\mathcal{L}(\phi;y)\leq\log m\_{y}(h) for each yy, the *difference* ℒ1∗−ℒ0∗\mathcal{L}^{\*}\_{1}-\mathcal{L}^{\*}\_{0} is generally neither a lower nor an upper bound on log⁡BFT\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}. Indeed,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | logmy(h)=ℒ(ϕ;y)+DKL(q(θ;ϕ)∥Π(θ∣h,y)),\log m\_{y}(h)=\mathcal{L}(\phi;y)+\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(q(\theta;\phi)\,\middle\|\,\Pi(\theta\mid h,y)\right), |  |

so the Bayes-factor error equals a *difference* of two nonnegative KL terms. In practice, accuracy can be assessed by (i) tighter bounds such as importance-weighted objectives, and/or (ii) post-hoc corrections via importance sampling or bridge sampling when feasible.

#### 5.2 Experiments

We evaluate the theory in controlled synthetic settings where the data-generating process is known, and we report summaries over repeated simulations to assess variability. Inference is performed under the same model class used for generation unless stated otherwise.

##### 5.2.1 Synthetic Experiments

###### Setup.

Data are generated from the Gaussian latent-type model of Example [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmexample1 "Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model). ‣ 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") with K=3K=3 types. Unless stated otherwise, parameters are fixed at:

* •

  Informed: μ1=0.5\mu\_{1}=0.5, λ1=0.1\lambda\_{1}=0.1, σ1=0.3\sigma\_{1}=0.3, κ1=0.05\kappa\_{1}=0.05
* •

  Noise: σ2=0.5\sigma\_{2}=0.5
* •

  Manipulator: μ3=0.3\mu\_{3}=0.3, τ3=5\tau\_{3}=5, σ3=0.4\sigma\_{3}=0.4, ν=5\nu=5
* •

  Base weights: 𝝎=(0.4,0.4,0.2)\bm{\omega}=(0.4,0.4,0.2)
* •

  Gating logits: γk,0=0\gamma\_{k,0}=0, γ1,1=0.5\gamma\_{1,1}=0.5, γ2,1=0\gamma\_{2,1}=0, γ3,1=0.3\gamma\_{3,1}=0.3

Volumes are sampled i.i.d. as Vt∼Gamma​(2,0.5)V\_{t}\sim\mathrm{Gamma}(2,0.5) (shape 22, scale 0.50.5). Each configuration is replicated 1000 times. Posterior quantities are computed by SMC with N=1000N=1000 particles, targeting the joint posterior on (Y,θ)(Y,\theta) under the priors specified in Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3 "3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types").222In synthetic experiments we use weakly informative priors with full support on the constrained parameter space and enforce the orientation constraints described in Section [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.SS1 "4.1 Induced Data Laws and KL Projections ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") to avoid outcome–parameter sign symmetries.

###### Experiment 1 (Posterior concentration).

We study the decay of posterior error with horizon TT. For T∈{10,25,50,100,200,500}T\in\{10,25,50,100,200,500\}, we simulate histories under Y=1Y=1, compute πT=ℙ​(Y=1∣HT)\pi\_{T}=\mathbb{P}(Y=1\mid H\_{T}), and record the error 1−πT1-\pi\_{T}. Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S5.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Experiment 1 (Posterior concentration). ‣ 5.2.1 Synthetic Experiments ‣ 5.2 Experiments ‣ 5 Computation and Empirical Validation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") reports the median of log⁡(1−πT)\log(1-\pi\_{T}) across replications with 10–90% quantile bands.

To relate the empirical decay to the theory, we estimate the separation gap δT​(1,θ⋆)\delta\_{T}(1,\theta^{\star}) by approximately solving the KL-projection problem

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | δT(1,θ⋆)=infθ∈Θ1TDKL(P1,θ⋆(T)∥P0,θ(T)),\delta\_{T}(1,\theta^{\star})=\inf\_{\theta\in\Theta}\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{1,\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{0,\theta}^{(T)}\right), |  |

using Monte Carlo estimates of the objective and stochastic optimization (Appendix). The dashed line in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S5.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Experiment 1 (Posterior concentration). ‣ 5.2.1 Synthetic Experiments ‣ 5.2 Experiments ‣ 5 Computation and Empirical Validation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") overlays slope −δ^T-\widehat{\delta}\_{T}. For the default parameters, δ^T≈1.5×10−2\widehat{\delta}\_{T}\approx 1.5\times 10^{-2} nats/period, consistent with a weak per-step signal under low-to-moderate realized volumes.

###### Experiment 2 (Identifiability threshold under type-composition shifts).

We quantify how inference degrades as the informed component becomes rare. We vary ω1∈{0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5}\omega\_{1}\in\{0.05,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5\}, setting ω2=ω3=(1−ω1)/2\omega\_{2}=\omega\_{3}=(1-\omega\_{1})/2, generate histories with T=100T=100, and report the fraction of replications in which arg​maxy⁡ℙ​(Y=y∣HT)\operatorname\*{arg\,max}\_{y}\mathbb{P}(Y=y\mid H\_{T}) matches the truth.

Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S5.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Experiment 2 (Identifiability threshold under type-composition shifts). ‣ 5.2.1 Synthetic Experiments ‣ 5.2 Experiments ‣ 5 Computation and Empirical Validation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") shows a marked deterioration as ω1\omega\_{1} falls below ≈0.15\approx 0.15. In this regime, the fitted KL-projection gap δ^T\widehat{\delta}\_{T} becomes small, consistent with the type-composition confounding mechanism in Proposition [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmproposition1 "Proposition 4.1 (Sufficient conditions for outcome non-identifiability). ‣ 4.2 Mechanisms of Non-Identifiability ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types").

Figure 2: Identifiability under decreasing informed weight. Posterior accuracy is the proportion of replications assigning higher posterior probability to the true outcome (here T=100T=100). Accuracy degrades sharply when ω1\omega\_{1} is sufficiently small, consistent with a vanishing separation gap.

###### Experiment 3 (Stability to perturbations).

We assess the stability of posterior odds under perturbations of a typical history. For a baseline draw hh with T=100T=100, we form perturbed histories h′h^{\prime} by adding i.i.d. Gaussian noise ϵt∼𝒩​(0,σ2)\epsilon\_{t}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2}) to the log-odds increments, i.e. Δ​xt′=Δ​xt+ϵt\Delta x^{\prime}\_{t}=\Delta x\_{t}+\epsilon\_{t}, with σ∈{0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2}\sigma\in\{0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2\}. We compare the observed change in log Bayes factor, |log⁡BFT​(h)−log⁡BFT​(h′)||\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h)-\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h^{\prime})|, to the stability bound of Theorem [4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem4 "Theorem 4.4 (Stability of posterior odds on typical histories). ‣ 4.5.3 Stability Theorem ‣ 4.5 Stability of Posterior Odds under Perturbations ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") instantiated on the truncation event ER={maxt⁡|Δ​xt|≤R}E\_{R}=\{\max\_{t}|\Delta x\_{t}|\leq R\}, with RR set to the empirical 0.990.99-quantile of maxt⁡|Δ​xt|\max\_{t}|\Delta x\_{t}| across baseline draws.

Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ Experiment 3 (Stability to perturbations). ‣ 5.2.1 Synthetic Experiments ‣ 5.2 Experiments ‣ 5 Computation and Empirical Validation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") exhibits the predicted linear scaling in perturbation magnitude; the bound is conservative, as expected from worst-case control on ERE\_{R}.

Points show |log⁡BFT​(h)−log⁡BFT​(h′)||\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h)-\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h^{\prime})| as a function of noise level σ\sigma; the dashed line is the stability bound from Theorem [4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem4 "Theorem 4.4 (Stability of posterior odds on typical histories). ‣ 4.5.3 Stability Theorem ‣ 4.5 Stability of Posterior Odds under Perturbations ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") evaluated with a high-probability truncation radius RR.

###### Experiment 4 (Information gain dynamics).

We track realized information gain IG​(Ht)\mathrm{IG}(H\_{t}) over long horizons. We simulate histories with T=600T=600 and compute IG​(Ht)\mathrm{IG}(H\_{t}) sequentially. Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S5.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ Experiment 4 (Information gain dynamics). ‣ 5.2.1 Synthetic Experiments ‣ 5.2 Experiments ‣ 5 Computation and Empirical Validation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") shows that IG​(Ht)\mathrm{IG}(H\_{t}) rises rapidly early in the history and then plateaus as the posterior concentrates. For the symmetric prior π0=1/2\pi\_{0}=1/2, the realized information gain is bounded above by log⁡2\log 2 nats, and the observed saturation is consistent with this ceiling.

### 6 Discussion

This paper develops a Bayesian inverse-problem perspective on inference from prediction market histories. The central object is the map from an unobserved binary outcome Y∈{0,1}Y\in\{0,1\} to an observed price–volume record HT=((Pt,Vt))t=0TH\_{T}=((P\_{t},V\_{t}))\_{t=0}^{T}, viewed as a stochastic sensing mechanism mediated by heterogeneous and partially strategic participation. Our modeling choice is deliberately mechanism-agnostic: we work in log-odds space and posit that increments Δ​Xt\Delta X\_{t} arise from a volume-gated mixture of latent trader types. This likelihood class is flexible enough to represent informative flow, uninformed trading, heavy-tailed microstructure noise, and adversarial or manipulative pressure while requiring only the observables that are typically available in practice.

Within this framework, inference about YY reduces to the marginal Bayes factor after integrating over nuisance structure. This makes it possible to state identifiability and well-posedness in operational terms. In particular, we formulate outcome distinguishability through KL projection gaps between the outcome-indexed families after optimizing over nuisance parameters, and we show how these gaps control posterior concentration and finite-sample error behavior under regularity conditions. Complementing concentration, we analyze stability of posterior odds to perturbations of the observed history on typical paths (formally, on high-probability truncation events). Finally, by expressing information gain in terms of posterior-vs-prior KL divergence and its expectation as mutual information, we obtain interpretable metrics for treating markets as sensors and for comparing regimes in which the price–volume record is genuinely informative versus regimes in which the inverse problem is ill-posed.

At the same time, several modeling choices delimit what the current results do and do not cover. Assumption [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmassumption1 "Assumption 3.1 (Conditional independence of increments). ‣ 3.6 Mixture Likelihood and Conditional Independence ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") abstracts away serial dependence such as volatility clustering, persistence in order flow, and regime switching. These effects are prominent in real markets and can matter precisely because they may imitate outcome-dependent drift or amplify the influence of rare large moves. Our observation model is also intentionally sparse: we condition only on price and volume, leaving out order book state, signed flow, open interest, and trader identities. Incorporating richer observables would likely sharpen identifiability diagnostics and reduce the extent to which nuisance structure can mimic outcome dependence. In addition, the latent-type representation fixes the number of types KK, which is useful for interpretability but potentially restrictive in heterogeneous real-world settings; model selection over KK or nonparametric mixtures could add flexibility at a computational cost. Finally, treating volume as a realized design sequence simplifies analysis but does not remove endogeneity: volume is itself shaped by information arrivals and strategic participation, and a fully coupled model for (Δ​Xt,Vt)(\Delta X\_{t},V\_{t}) would be needed to explicitly quantify how endogeneity affects separation, concentration, and stability.

These limitations also point to natural extensions that preserve the inverse-problem viewpoint. One direction is to replace conditional independence with dependent increment models—for example, Markov structure or conditionally heteroskedastic dynamics—and to adapt the concentration and robustness arguments using martingale techniques. Another is to generalize the inferential target beyond a binary outcome to categorical or continuous YY, where identifiability becomes a multi-way separation problem among outcome-conditioned families. On the computational side, sequential Monte Carlo naturally supports online inference, enabling streaming posterior updates and uncertainty quantification in live markets. Finally, the separation gap and information-gain functionals suggest a route toward market design: mechanism parameters such as fees, batching intervals, disclosure rules, or market-maker settings can be evaluated in terms of how they affect distinguishability of outcomes from observable histories, rather than only in terms of equilibrium benchmarks.

Prediction markets continue to grow in importance for forecasting and decision support, yet the relationship between dispersed information and observed prices is mediated by noise, heterogeneity, and incentives. By casting the problem as Bayesian inversion from price–volume histories, the present framework provides tools for quantifying what can be learned, for diagnosing when inference is reliable and stable, and for identifying regimes in which ambiguity is structural rather than merely a reflection of limited data.

## Appendix

### Appendix A Proofs and Additional Technical Results

This appendix collects full proofs and auxiliary technical statements supporting the results in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4 "4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types").
Throughout, we fix a deterministic volume design v1:Tv\_{1:T} and write Py,θ(T)P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)} for the induced law of Δ​X1:T\Delta X\_{1:T} under outcome yy and nuisance parameter θ\theta.

#### A.1 Identifiability and non-identifiability

##### A.1.1 Proof of Proposition [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmproposition1 "Proposition 4.1 (Sufficient conditions for outcome non-identifiability). ‣ 4.2 Mechanisms of Non-Identifiability ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")

###### Proof.

Fix a horizon TT and a realized volume design v1:Tv\_{1:T}. Recall the (truth-relative) KL gap

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | δT=KT(y⋆,θ⋆→1−y⋆):=infθ∈Θ1TDKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥P1−y⋆,θ(T)).\delta\_{T}\;=\;K\_{T}\!\left(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}\to 1-y^{\star}\right)\;:=\;\inf\_{\theta\in\Theta}\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)}\right). |  |

By definition, non-identifiability at horizon TT for the truth (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) occurs whenever δT=0\delta\_{T}=0.

###### (1) Type-composition confounding.

Assume that along the realized volume design v1:Tv\_{1:T}, all *active* types under θ⋆\theta^{\star} are outcome-independent, i.e.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ρk(vt;θ⋆)>0⟹fk,1(⋅∣vt,θk⋆)=fk,0(⋅∣vt,θk⋆)for every t∈{1,…,T}.\rho\_{k}(v\_{t};\theta^{\star})>0\implies f\_{k,1}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta\_{k}^{\star})=f\_{k,0}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta\_{k}^{\star})\qquad\text{for every }t\in\{1,\dots,T\}. |  |

Then for each tt,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | f1(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)\displaystyle f\_{1}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star}) | =∑k=1Kρk(vt;θ⋆)fk,1(⋅∣vt,θk⋆)=∑k=1Kρk(vt;θ⋆)fk,0(⋅∣vt,θk⋆)=f0(⋅∣vt,θ⋆).\displaystyle=\sum\_{k=1}^{K}\rho\_{k}(v\_{t};\theta^{\star})\,f\_{k,1}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta\_{k}^{\star})=\sum\_{k=1}^{K}\rho\_{k}(v\_{t};\theta^{\star})\,f\_{k,0}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta\_{k}^{\star})=f\_{0}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star}). |  |

By conditional independence (Assumption [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmassumption1 "Assumption 3.1 (Conditional independence of increments). ‣ 3.6 Mixture Likelihood and Conditional Independence ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")), this implies equality of the induced product measures:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | P1,θ⋆(T)=P0,θ⋆(T).P\_{1,\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}=P\_{0,\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}. |  |

Consequently,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | DKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥P1−y⋆,θ⋆(T))=0,\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\right)=0, |  |

so δT=0\delta\_{T}=0.

###### (2) Outcome-symmetry of the nuisance class.

Assume there exists a measurable map Ψ:Θ→Θ\Psi:\Theta\to\Theta such that, for each tt,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f1(⋅∣vt,θ)=f0(⋅∣vt,Ψ(θ))for all θ∈Θ.f\_{1}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)=f\_{0}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\Psi(\theta))\qquad\text{for all }\theta\in\Theta. |  |

Then again by product structure,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | P1,θ(T)=P0,Ψ​(θ)(T)for all ​θ∈Θ.P\_{1,\theta}^{(T)}=P\_{0,\Psi(\theta)}^{(T)}\qquad\text{for all }\theta\in\Theta. |  |

If the truth has y⋆=1y^{\star}=1, choose the alternative parameter θ:=Ψ​(θ⋆)\theta:=\Psi(\theta^{\star}); then
P1,θ⋆(T)=P0,θ(T)P\_{1,\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}=P\_{0,\theta}^{(T)} and hence δT=0\delta\_{T}=0.
If the truth has y⋆=0y^{\star}=0 and Ψ\Psi is surjective (in particular, if Ψ\Psi is an involution, Ψ∘Ψ=id\Psi\circ\Psi=\mathrm{id}), then there exists θ~\tilde{\theta} with Ψ​(θ~)=θ⋆\Psi(\tilde{\theta})=\theta^{\star}, so P0,θ⋆(T)=P1,θ~(T)P\_{0,\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}=P\_{1,\tilde{\theta}}^{(T)} and again δT=0\delta\_{T}=0.

###### (3) Adversarial mimicry.

Assume there exists θ~∈Θ\tilde{\theta}\in\Theta such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Py⋆,θ⋆(T)=P1−y⋆,θ~(T).P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}=P\_{1-y^{\star},\tilde{\theta}}^{(T)}. |  |

Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | DKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥P1−y⋆,θ~(T))=0,\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{1-y^{\star},\tilde{\theta}}^{(T)}\right)=0, |  |

and taking the infimum over θ\theta yields δT=0\delta\_{T}=0.

In each case δT=0\delta\_{T}=0, so the outcome is not identifiable at horizon TT for the truth (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}).
∎

##### A.1.2 Proof of Theorem [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem1 "Theorem 4.1 (A design-based sufficient condition for outcome separation). ‣ 4.3 Sufficient Conditions for Separation in the Gaussian Model ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")

###### Proof.

Fix TT and a truth (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}) satisfying the theorem hypotheses.
For each time index t∈{1,…,T}t\in\{1,\dots,T\} define the *one-step* KL divergence functional

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | κt(θ):=DKL(fy⋆(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)∥f1−y⋆(⋅∣vt,θ)),θ∈Θ.\kappa\_{t}(\theta)\;:=\;\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(f\_{y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star})\,\middle\|\,f\_{1-y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)\right),\qquad\theta\in\Theta. |  |

By Assumption [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmassumption1 "Assumption 3.1 (Conditional independence of increments). ‣ 3.6 Mixture Likelihood and Conditional Independence ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") and additivity of KL for product measures,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | DKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥P1−y⋆,θ(T))=∑t=1Tκt(θ).\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)}\right)=\sum\_{t=1}^{T}\kappa\_{t}(\theta). |  | (21) |

###### Step 1: Pointwise positivity on informative times.

Let t∈ITt\in I\_{T} be an informative time index. We show that κt​(θ)>0\kappa\_{t}(\theta)>0 for every θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta.

On ITI\_{T}, the hypotheses impose:
(i) *informed activation* under θ⋆\theta^{\star}, i.e. ρ1​(vt;θ⋆)≥ρ¯\rho\_{1}(v\_{t};\theta^{\star})\geq\underline{\rho} and
|m1,1​(vt;θ1⋆)−m1,0​(vt;θ1⋆)|≥m¯|m\_{1,1}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1}^{\star})-m\_{1,0}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1}^{\star})|\geq\underline{m};
(ii) *manipulator inactivity* (the type-3 drift is outcome-independent, hence contributes zero mean shift);
and (iii) *orientation constraint* μ1≥0\mu\_{1}\geq 0 for type 1, so that m1,1​(v;θ1)≥0m\_{1,1}(v;\theta\_{1})\geq 0 and m1,0​(v;θ1)≤0m\_{1,0}(v;\theta\_{1})\leq 0 for all θ1\theta\_{1} and all vv.

Consider the conditional mean of the increment at time tt.
Because type 2 has zero drift by construction and type 3 has m3,1≡m3,0≡0m\_{3,1}\equiv m\_{3,0}\equiv 0 on ITI\_{T}, we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼fy(⋅∣vt,θ)​[Δ​Xt]=ρ1​(vt;θ)​m1,y​(vt;θ1)for ​y∈{0,1}.\mathbb{E}\_{f\_{y}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)}[\Delta X\_{t}]=\rho\_{1}(v\_{t};\theta)\,m\_{1,y}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1})\qquad\text{for }y\in\{0,1\}. |  |

For the truth (y⋆,θ⋆)(y^{\star},\theta^{\star}), the informed-drift separation implies

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |m1,y⋆​(vt;θ1⋆)|=12​|m1,1​(vt;θ1⋆)−m1,0​(vt;θ1⋆)|≥m¯/2,|m\_{1,y^{\star}}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1}^{\star})|=\tfrac{1}{2}|m\_{1,1}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1}^{\star})-m\_{1,0}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1}^{\star})|\geq\underline{m}/2, |  |

and hence

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | |𝔼fy⋆(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)​[Δ​Xt]|=ρ1​(vt;θ⋆)​|m1,y⋆​(vt;θ1⋆)|≥ρ¯​m¯/2.\Big|\mathbb{E}\_{f\_{y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star})}[\Delta X\_{t}]\Big|=\rho\_{1}(v\_{t};\theta^{\star})\,|m\_{1,y^{\star}}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1}^{\star})|\geq\underline{\rho}\,\underline{m}/2. |  | (22) |

Moreover, the sign of this mean is sign⁡(2​y⋆−1)\operatorname{sign}(2y^{\star}-1).

Now fix any θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta and consider the wrong-outcome density f1−y⋆(⋅∣vt,θ)f\_{1-y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta).
By the orientation constraint, m1,1−y⋆​(vt;θ1)m\_{1,1-y^{\star}}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1}) has sign *opposite* to m1,y⋆​(vt;θ1⋆)m\_{1,y^{\star}}(v\_{t};\theta\_{1}^{\star}) (or is zero), and ρ1​(vt;θ)≥0\rho\_{1}(v\_{t};\theta)\geq 0.
Therefore,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | sign⁡(𝔼f1−y⋆(⋅∣vt,θ)​[Δ​Xt])∈{0,−sign⁡(2​y⋆−1)}.\operatorname{sign}\Big(\mathbb{E}\_{f\_{1-y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)}[\Delta X\_{t}]\Big)\in\{0,-\operatorname{sign}(2y^{\star}-1)\}. |  |

In particular, the conditional means under fy⋆(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)f\_{y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star}) and f1−y⋆(⋅∣vt,θ)f\_{1-y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta) cannot coincide:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼fy⋆(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)​[Δ​Xt]≠𝔼f1−y⋆(⋅∣vt,θ)​[Δ​Xt].\mathbb{E}\_{f\_{y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star})}[\Delta X\_{t}]\neq\mathbb{E}\_{f\_{1-y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)}[\Delta X\_{t}]. |  |

Since equality of densities a.e. would imply equality of their first moments, we conclude that
fy⋆(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)≠f1−y⋆(⋅∣vt,θ)f\_{y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star})\neq f\_{1-y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta) a.e., hence

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | κt(θ)=DKL(fy⋆(⋅∣vt,θ⋆)∥f1−y⋆(⋅∣vt,θ))>0for all θ∈Θ.\kappa\_{t}(\theta)=\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(f\_{y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star})\,\middle\|\,f\_{1-y^{\star}}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta)\right)>0\qquad\text{for all }\theta\in\Theta. |  |

###### Step 2: Uniform positivity via compactness.

For each fixed t∈ITt\in I\_{T}, the map θ↦κt​(θ)\theta\mapsto\kappa\_{t}(\theta) is continuous on Θ\Theta under the regularity conditions in item (3) of Theorem [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem1 "Theorem 4.1 (A design-based sufficient condition for outcome separation). ‣ 4.3 Sufficient Conditions for Separation in the Gaussian Model ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") (bounded nondegenerate scales and smoothness of the component families).
Since Θ\Theta is compact, κt\kappa\_{t} attains its minimum:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | κ¯t:=minθ∈Θ⁡κt​(θ).\underline{\kappa}\_{t}\;:=\;\min\_{\theta\in\Theta}\kappa\_{t}(\theta). |  |

By Step 1, κ¯t>0\underline{\kappa}\_{t}>0 for every t∈ITt\in I\_{T}.
Define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | κ:=mint∈IT⁡κ¯t,\kappa\;:=\;\min\_{t\in I\_{T}}\underline{\kappa}\_{t}, |  |

which is strictly positive because ITI\_{T} is finite for fixed TT.

###### Step 3: Lower bound on the KL gap.

Combining ([21](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#A1.E21 "In Proof. ‣ A.1.2 Proof of Theorem 4.1 ‣ A.1 Identifiability and non-identifiability ‣ Appendix A Proofs and Additional Technical Results ‣ Appendix ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")) with the definition of κ\kappa yields, for any θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1TDKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥P1−y⋆,θ(T))=1T∑t=1Tκt(θ)≥1T∑t∈ITκt(θ)≥|IT|Tκ.\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)}\right)=\frac{1}{T}\sum\_{t=1}^{T}\kappa\_{t}(\theta)\geq\frac{1}{T}\sum\_{t\in I\_{T}}\kappa\_{t}(\theta)\geq\frac{|I\_{T}|}{T}\,\kappa. |  |

Taking the infimum over θ\theta gives

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | δT=infθ∈Θ1TDKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥P1−y⋆,θ(T))≥|IT|Tκ,\delta\_{T}=\inf\_{\theta\in\Theta}\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)}\right)\geq\frac{|I\_{T}|}{T}\,\kappa, |  |

which is the desired bound.

###### Step 1: Laplace-type bounds for 1T​log⁡my​(HT)\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{y}(H\_{T}).

Recall

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | my​(HT)=∫Θexp⁡(T​Ly,T​(θ))​Π​(d​θ).m\_{y}(H\_{T})=\int\_{\Theta}\exp\!\big(T\,L\_{y,T}(\theta)\big)\,\Pi(d\theta). |  |

*Upper bound.*
Since Π\Pi is a probability measure,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | my​(HT)≤supθ∈Θexp⁡(T​Ly,T​(θ))=exp⁡(T​supθ∈ΘLy,T​(θ)),m\_{y}(H\_{T})\leq\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}\exp\!\big(T\,L\_{y,T}(\theta)\big)=\exp\!\Big(T\,\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}L\_{y,T}(\theta)\Big), |  |

so

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1T​log⁡my​(HT)≤supθ∈ΘLy,T​(θ)≤supθ∈ΘΛy,T​(θ)+aT.\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{y}(H\_{T})\leq\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}L\_{y,T}(\theta)\leq\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)+a\_{T}. |  |

*Lower bound.*
Fix η>0\eta>0 and define the near-maximizer set

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Ay,T​(η):={θ∈Θ:Λy,T​(θ)≥supϑ∈ΘΛy,T​(ϑ)−η}.A\_{y,T}(\eta):=\Big\{\theta\in\Theta:\ \Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)\geq\sup\_{\vartheta\in\Theta}\Lambda\_{y,T}(\vartheta)-\eta\Big\}. |  |

Because Λy,T​(θ)=Λy⋆,T​(θ⋆)−1T​DKL​(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥Py,θ(T))\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)=\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})-\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\|P\_{y,\theta}^{(T)}), the set Ay,T​(η)A\_{y,T}(\eta) coincides with the “near-projection” set in Assumption [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption3 "Assumption 4.3 (KL support at (near) projections). ‣ 4.4.1 Regularity Conditions ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"). Hence Π​(Ay,T​(η))≥c​(η)>0\Pi(A\_{y,T}(\eta))\geq c(\eta)>0 for TT large enough.

Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | my​(HT)\displaystyle m\_{y}(H\_{T}) | ≥∫Ay,T​(η)exp⁡(T​Ly,T​(θ))​Π​(d​θ)\displaystyle\geq\int\_{A\_{y,T}(\eta)}\exp\!\big(T\,L\_{y,T}(\theta)\big)\,\Pi(d\theta) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | ≥Π​(Ay,T​(η))​exp⁡(T​infθ∈Ay,T​(η)Ly,T​(θ)).\displaystyle\geq\Pi(A\_{y,T}(\eta))\,\exp\!\Big(T\,\inf\_{\theta\in A\_{y,T}(\eta)}L\_{y,T}(\theta)\Big). |  |

Using |Ly,T−Λy,T|≤aT|L\_{y,T}-\Lambda\_{y,T}|\leq a\_{T},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | infθ∈Ay,T​(η)Ly,T​(θ)≥infθ∈Ay,T​(η)Λy,T​(θ)−aT≥supθ∈ΘΛy,T​(θ)−η−aT.\inf\_{\theta\in A\_{y,T}(\eta)}L\_{y,T}(\theta)\geq\inf\_{\theta\in A\_{y,T}(\eta)}\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)-a\_{T}\geq\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)-\eta-a\_{T}. |  |

Therefore

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1T​log⁡my​(HT)≥supθ∈ΘΛy,T​(θ)−η−aT+1T​log⁡Π​(Ay,T​(η)).\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{y}(H\_{T})\geq\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)-\eta-a\_{T}+\frac{1}{T}\log\Pi(A\_{y,T}(\eta)). |  |

###### Step 2: Relating suprema to δT\delta\_{T}.

First note that supθΛy⋆,T​(θ)=Λy⋆,T​(θ⋆)\sup\_{\theta}\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta)=\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star}) because
DKL​(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥Py⋆,θ(T))≥0\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\|P\_{y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)})\geq 0 with equality at θ=θ⋆\theta=\theta^{\star}.

Moreover,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | supθ∈ΘΛ1−y⋆,T​(θ)=Λy⋆,T​(θ⋆)−δT,\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}\Lambda\_{1-y^{\star},T}(\theta)=\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})-\delta\_{T}, |  |

because

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Λy⋆,T(θ⋆)−Λ1−y⋆,T(θ)=1TDKL(Py⋆,θ⋆(T)∥P1−y⋆,θ(T))\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})-\Lambda\_{1-y^{\star},T}(\theta)=\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(P\_{y^{\star},\theta^{\star}}^{(T)}\,\middle\|\,P\_{1-y^{\star},\theta}^{(T)}\right) |  |

and δT\delta\_{T} is the infimum of the right-hand side over θ\theta.

###### Step 3: Conclude the Bayes-factor bounds.

Apply the bounds from Step 1 with η=ϵ/4\eta=\epsilon/4 and take TT large enough so that aT≤ϵ/4a\_{T}\leq\epsilon/4 and 1T​|log⁡Π​(Ay,T​(η))|≤ϵ/4\frac{1}{T}|\log\Pi(A\_{y,T}(\eta))|\leq\epsilon/4 (the latter holds because Π​(Ay,T​(η))≥c​(η)>0\Pi(A\_{y,T}(\eta))\geq c(\eta)>0).

For y=y⋆y=y^{\star} we obtain

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1T​log⁡my⋆​(HT)≥Λy⋆,T​(θ⋆)−ϵ/2,1T​log⁡my⋆​(HT)≤Λy⋆,T​(θ⋆)+ϵ/4.\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{y^{\star}}(H\_{T})\geq\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})-\epsilon/2,\qquad\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{y^{\star}}(H\_{T})\leq\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})+\epsilon/4. |  |

For y=1−y⋆y=1-y^{\star} we obtain

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1T​log⁡m1−y⋆​(HT)≤supθΛ1−y⋆,T​(θ)+ϵ/4=Λy⋆,T​(θ⋆)−δT+ϵ/4,\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{1-y^{\star}}(H\_{T})\leq\sup\_{\theta}\Lambda\_{1-y^{\star},T}(\theta)+\epsilon/4=\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})-\delta\_{T}+\epsilon/4, |  |

and

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1T​log⁡m1−y⋆​(HT)≥supθΛ1−y⋆,T​(θ)−ϵ/2=Λy⋆,T​(θ⋆)−δT−ϵ/2.\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{1-y^{\star}}(H\_{T})\geq\sup\_{\theta}\Lambda\_{1-y^{\star},T}(\theta)-\epsilon/2=\Lambda\_{y^{\star},T}(\theta^{\star})-\delta\_{T}-\epsilon/2. |  |

Subtracting yields, for all sufficiently large TT,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1T​log⁡BFT​(HT)=1T​log⁡m1​(HT)−1T​log⁡m0​(HT)≥δT−ϵ\frac{1}{T}\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(H\_{T})=\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{1}(H\_{T})-\frac{1}{T}\log m\_{0}(H\_{T})\geq\delta\_{T}-\epsilon |  |

if y⋆=1y^{\star}=1, and similarly the corresponding lower bound on −1T​log⁡BFT​(HT)-\frac{1}{T}\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(H\_{T}) if y⋆=0y^{\star}=0.
The stated upper bounds follow by subtracting the corresponding upper and lower bounds in the opposite direction (which is why the theorem states the upper bound only for the “correctly oriented” Bayes factor).

##### A.2.2 Proof of Proposition [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmproposition2 "Proposition 4.2 (Finite-sample posterior error bound (robust form)). ‣ 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")

###### Proof.

We provide a finite-sample bound by combining (i) a truncation argument ensuring bounded log-likelihood ratios on a high-probability event and (ii) an exponential deviation bound for a uniform LLN event.

###### Step 1: Truncation and a bounded-ratio event.

Fix R>0R>0 and recall

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ER:={max1≤t≤T⁡|Δ​Xt|≤R}.E\_{R}:=\Big\{\max\_{1\leq t\leq T}|\Delta X\_{t}|\leq R\Big\}. |  |

By Assumption [4.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption5 "Assumption 4.5 (Moment control for increments). ‣ 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"), Markov’s inequality and a union bound give

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℙ​(ERc)≤∑t=1Tℙ​(|Δ​Xt|>R)≤∑t=1T𝔼​|Δ​Xt|qRq≤T​Cq​R−q.\mathbb{P}(E\_{R}^{c})\leq\sum\_{t=1}^{T}\mathbb{P}(|\Delta X\_{t}|>R)\leq\sum\_{t=1}^{T}\frac{\mathbb{E}|\Delta X\_{t}|^{q}}{R^{q}}\leq T\,C\_{q}\,R^{-q}. |  |

On ERE\_{R}, the constant

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | BR:=supθ∈Θsupt≤Tsup|x|≤R|log⁡fy⋆​(x∣vt,θ⋆)f1−y⋆​(x∣vt,θ)|B\_{R}:=\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}\ \sup\_{t\leq T}\ \sup\_{|x|\leq R}\left|\log\frac{f\_{y^{\star}}(x\mid v\_{t},\theta^{\star})}{f\_{1-y^{\star}}(x\mid v\_{t},\theta)}\right| |  |

is finite by compactness of Θ\Theta, continuity of (x,θ)↦fy​(x∣vt,θ)(x,\theta)\mapsto f\_{y}(x\mid v\_{t},\theta), and strict positivity of the component families for location–scale models with nondegenerate scales.

###### Step 2: A deviation event controlling the Bayes factor.

Fix ϵ∈(0,δT)\epsilon\in(0,\delta\_{T}) and define η:=ϵ/4\eta:=\epsilon/4.
Let AT​(η)A\_{T}(\eta) denote the event that the Laplace bounds in the proof of Theorem [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem2 "Theorem 4.2 (Asymptotic separation of Bayes factors (robust form)). ‣ 4.4.2 Bayes Factor Separation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") hold with error at most η\eta for both outcomes y=0,1y=0,1.
(Concretely, AT​(η)A\_{T}(\eta) is implied by the uniform LLN event maxy​supθ|Ly,T​(θ)−Λy,T​(θ)|≤η\max\_{y}\sup\_{\theta}|L\_{y,T}(\theta)-\Lambda\_{y,T}(\theta)|\leq\eta together with 1T​|log⁡Π​(Ay,T​(η))|≤η\frac{1}{T}|\log\Pi(A\_{y,T}(\eta))|\leq\eta, which holds for TT large by Assumption [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption3 "Assumption 4.3 (KL support at (near) projections). ‣ 4.4.1 Regularity Conditions ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types").)

On AT​(η)A\_{T}(\eta) we have, by the same subtraction as in Theorem [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem2 "Theorem 4.2 (Asymptotic separation of Bayes factors (robust form)). ‣ 4.4.2 Bayes Factor Separation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types"),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1T​log⁡BFT​(HT)≥δT−4​η=δT−ϵif ​y⋆=1,\frac{1}{T}\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(H\_{T})\geq\delta\_{T}-4\eta=\delta\_{T}-\epsilon\qquad\text{if }y^{\star}=1, |  |

and analogously −1T​log⁡BFT​(HT)≥δT−ϵ-\frac{1}{T}\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(H\_{T})\geq\delta\_{T}-\epsilon if y⋆=0y^{\star}=0.
In either case, |log⁡BFT​(HT)|≥T​(δT−ϵ)|\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(H\_{T})|\geq T(\delta\_{T}-\epsilon) with the correct sign.

Since posterior odds satisfy ([7](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.E7 "In 3.8 Prior and Posterior ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")), this implies an exponential bound on posterior error on AT​(η)A\_{T}(\eta):

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℙ​(Y≠y⋆∣HT)≤1−π0π0​exp⁡(−T​(δT−ϵ))if ​y⋆=1,\mathbb{P}(Y\neq y^{\star}\mid H\_{T})\leq\frac{1-\pi\_{0}}{\pi\_{0}}\exp\!\big(-T(\delta\_{T}-\epsilon)\big)\qquad\text{if }y^{\star}=1, |  |

and the analogous bound with π0/(1−π0)\pi\_{0}/(1-\pi\_{0}) if y⋆=0y^{\star}=0.
Absorbing the constant prefactor into the exponential for large TT yields the stated form (since (1/T)​log⁡1−π0π0→0(1/T)\log\frac{1-\pi\_{0}}{\pi\_{0}}\to 0).

Therefore, for TT large enough,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | {ℙ​(Y≠y⋆∣HT)≥e−T​(δT−ϵ)}⊆AT​(η)c.\Big\{\mathbb{P}(Y\neq y^{\star}\mid H\_{T})\geq e^{-T(\delta\_{T}-\epsilon)}\Big\}\subseteq A\_{T}(\eta)^{c}. |  |

###### Step 3: Exponential control of AT​(η)cA\_{T}(\eta)^{c} on ERE\_{R}.

To obtain an explicit tail, it suffices to control the uniform LLN deviation probability on ERE\_{R}.
Under bounded-ratio control on ERE\_{R}, standard empirical-process arguments (e.g. ε\varepsilon-net discretization of Θ\Theta combined with Hoeffding’s inequality and Lipschitz dependence of logfy(⋅∣vt,θ)\log f\_{y}(\cdot\mid v\_{t},\theta) in θ\theta over compact Θ\Theta) yield an exponential bound of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℙ​(AT​(η)c∩ER)≤exp⁡(−T​ϵ22​BR2),\mathbb{P}\big(A\_{T}(\eta)^{c}\cap E\_{R}\big)\leq\exp\!\Big(-\frac{T\epsilon^{2}}{2B\_{R}^{2}}\Big), |  |

up to a subexponential prefactor depending on the metric entropy of Θ\Theta.
For notational simplicity (and consistent with the main text statement), we absorb such prefactors into the leading exponential rate.

###### Step 4: Combine.

Finally,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℙ​(ℙ​(Y≠y⋆∣HT)≥e−T​(δT−ϵ))≤ℙ​(AT​(η)c∩ER)+ℙ​(ERc)≤exp⁡(−T​ϵ22​BR2)+ℙ​(ERc),\mathbb{P}\!\left(\mathbb{P}(Y\neq y^{\star}\mid H\_{T})\geq e^{-T(\delta\_{T}-\epsilon)}\right)\leq\mathbb{P}\big(A\_{T}(\eta)^{c}\cap E\_{R}\big)+\mathbb{P}(E\_{R}^{c})\leq\exp\!\Big(-\frac{T\epsilon^{2}}{2B\_{R}^{2}}\Big)+\mathbb{P}(E\_{R}^{c}), |  |

as claimed.

#### A.3 Stability of posterior odds

##### A.3.1 Proof of Theorem [4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmtheorem4 "Theorem 4.4 (Stability of posterior odds on typical histories). ‣ 4.5.3 Stability Theorem ‣ 4.5 Stability of Posterior Odds under Perturbations ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")

###### Proof.

Fix histories h=(p0:T,v1:T)h=(p\_{0:T},v\_{1:T}) and h′=(p0:T′,v1:T′)h^{\prime}=(p^{\prime}\_{0:T},v^{\prime}\_{1:T}) with log-odds increments Δ​x1:T\Delta x\_{1:T} and Δ​x1:T′\Delta x^{\prime}\_{1:T}.
Fix R>0R>0 and work on the event ER​(h,h′)E\_{R}(h,h^{\prime}) defined in (LABEL:eq:trunc-event) so that |Δ​xt|∨|Δ​xt′|≤R|\Delta x\_{t}|\vee|\Delta x^{\prime}\_{t}|\leq R for all tt.

###### Step 1: Pointwise log-likelihood stability.

Assumption [4.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption6 "Assumption 4.6 (Local Lipschitz regularity on bounded increments). ‣ 4.5.2 Local Lipschitz Regularity ‣ 4.5 Stability of Posterior Odds under Perturbations ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") implies that for any y∈{0,1}y\in\{0,1\}, any θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta, and any t≤Tt\leq T,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |logfy(Δxt∣vt,θ)−logfy(Δxt′∣vt′,θ)|≤Lx(R)|Δxt−Δxt′|+Lv|vt−vt′|.\big|\log f\_{y}(\Delta x\_{t}\mid v\_{t},\theta)-\log f\_{y}(\Delta x^{\prime}\_{t}\mid v^{\prime}\_{t},\theta)\big|\leq L\_{x}(R)\,|\Delta x\_{t}-\Delta x^{\prime}\_{t}|+L\_{v}\,|v\_{t}-v^{\prime}\_{t}|. |  |

Summing over tt gives

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | |ℓy,T​(θ;h)−ℓy,T​(θ;h′)|≤Lx​(R)​∑t=1T|Δ​xt−Δ​xt′|+Lv​∑t=1T|vt−vt′|.\Big|\ell\_{y,T}(\theta;h)-\ell\_{y,T}(\theta;h^{\prime})\Big|\leq L\_{x}(R)\sum\_{t=1}^{T}|\Delta x\_{t}-\Delta x^{\prime}\_{t}|+L\_{v}\sum\_{t=1}^{T}|v\_{t}-v^{\prime}\_{t}|. |  | (23) |

###### Step 2: Log-sum-exp Lipschitz lemma.

We use the elementary inequality: for any measurable aθ,bθa\_{\theta},b\_{\theta} and probability measure Π\Pi,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |log​∫eaθ​Π​(d​θ)−log​∫ebθ​Π​(d​θ)|≤supθ∈Θ|aθ−bθ|.\left|\log\int e^{a\_{\theta}}\,\Pi(d\theta)-\log\int e^{b\_{\theta}}\,\Pi(d\theta)\right|\leq\sup\_{\theta\in\Theta}|a\_{\theta}-b\_{\theta}|. |  |

It follows by writing bθ≤aθ+sup|a−b|b\_{\theta}\leq a\_{\theta}+\sup|a-b|, integrating, and taking logs; symmetry gives the absolute value bound.

###### Step 3: Stability of marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors.

Apply the lemma with
aθ=ℓy,T​(θ;h)a\_{\theta}=\ell\_{y,T}(\theta;h) and bθ=ℓy,T​(θ;h′)b\_{\theta}=\ell\_{y,T}(\theta;h^{\prime}):

Combining with ([23](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#A1.E23 "In Step 1: Pointwise log-likelihood stability. ‣ A.3.1 Proof of Theorem 4.4 ‣ A.3 Stability of posterior odds ‣ Appendix A Proofs and Additional Technical Results ‣ Appendix ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")) yields, on ER​(h,h′)E\_{R}(h,h^{\prime}),

π↦logit​(π)\pi\mapsto\mathrm{logit}(\pi) is the inverse of the logistic sigmoid σ​(x)=1/(1+e−x)\sigma(x)=1/(1+e^{-x}).

##### A.4.1 Proof of Proposition [4.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmproposition3 "Proposition 4.3 (Properties of realized information gain). ‣ 4.6.1 Realized Information Gain ‣ 4.6 Information Gain and Market-as-Sensor Metrics ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")

###### Proof.

Write πT=πT​(h):=ℙ​(Y=1∣h)\pi\_{T}=\pi\_{T}(h):=\mathbb{P}(Y=1\mid h) and recall

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | IG(h)=DKL(Bern(πT)∥Bern(π0))=πTlogπTπ0+(1−πT)log1−πT1−π0.\mathrm{IG}(h)=\mathrm{D\_{KL}}\!\left(\mathrm{Bern}(\pi\_{T})\,\middle\|\,\mathrm{Bern}(\pi\_{0})\right)=\pi\_{T}\log\frac{\pi\_{T}}{\pi\_{0}}+(1-\pi\_{T})\log\frac{1-\pi\_{T}}{1-\pi\_{0}}. |  |

###### (1) Nonnegativity.

This is the standard nonnegativity of KL divergence. Equality holds iff the two Bernoulli laws coincide, i.e. πT=π0\pi\_{T}=\pi\_{0}.

###### (2) Upper bound.

For fixed π0∈(0,1)\pi\_{0}\in(0,1), the function

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | π↦DKL​(Bern​(π)∥Bern​(π0))\pi\mapsto\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(\mathrm{Bern}(\pi)\,\|\,\mathrm{Bern}(\pi\_{0})) |  |

is convex in π\pi and hence attains its maximum over π∈[0,1]\pi\in[0,1] at the endpoints.
Evaluating at π=1\pi=1 and π=0\pi=0 gives

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | IG​(h)≤max⁡{log⁡1π0,log⁡11−π0}.\mathrm{IG}(h)\leq\max\Big\{\log\frac{1}{\pi\_{0}},\,\log\frac{1}{1-\pi\_{0}}\Big\}. |  |

###### (3) Monotonicity in |log⁡BFT​(h)||\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h)|.

From ([7](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.E7 "In 3.8 Prior and Posterior ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")), logit​(πT)=logit​(π0)+log⁡BFT​(h)\mathrm{logit}(\pi\_{T})=\mathrm{logit}(\pi\_{0})+\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h).
Define u:=logit​(πT)−logit​(π0)=log⁡BFT​(h)u:=\mathrm{logit}(\pi\_{T})-\mathrm{logit}(\pi\_{0})=\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h) and write π​(u):=σ​(logit​(π0)+u)\pi(u):=\sigma(\mathrm{logit}(\pi\_{0})+u).
Then IG​(h)=F​(u)\mathrm{IG}(h)=F(u) where

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F​(u)=DKL​(Bern​(π​(u))∥Bern​(π0)).F(u)=\mathrm{D\_{KL}}(\mathrm{Bern}(\pi(u))\,\|\,\mathrm{Bern}(\pi\_{0})). |  |

A direct differentiation shows F′​(u)=u​π​(u)​(1−π​(u))F^{\prime}(u)=u\,\pi(u)(1-\pi(u)), hence F′​(u)F^{\prime}(u) has the same sign as uu.
Therefore F​(u)F(u) is increasing in uu for u>0u>0 and decreasing for u<0u<0, which implies F​(u)F(u) is a monotone function of |u|=|log⁡BFT​(h)||u|=|\log\mathrm{BF}\_{T}(h)|.

#### A.5 Verifying regularity assumptions for the Gaussian latent-type model

We record a convenient sufficient condition ensuring that the Gaussian latent-type model in Example [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmexample1 "Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model). ‣ 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") satisfies the regularity assumptions used in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4 "4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types").

###### Proposition A.1 (Sufficient parameter constraints for regularity).

Consider Example [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.Thmexample1 "Example 3.1 (Gaussian latent-type model). ‣ 3.7 A Concrete Instantiation: Gaussian Latent-Type Model ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") with the softmax gating ([1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S3.E1 "In 3.4 Volume-Dependent Gating ‣ 3 Model and Bayesian Formulation ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")).
Assume the parameter space is restricted by the following bounds:

1. 1.

   *Compactness:* all scalar parameters lie in closed bounded intervals and 𝝎\bm{\omega} lies in the simplex; in particular μ1,μ3∈[0,Mμ]\mu\_{1},\mu\_{3}\in[0,M\_{\mu}], λ1,κ1∈[0,Mλ]\lambda\_{1},\kappa\_{1}\in[0,M\_{\lambda}], τ3∈[0,Mτ]\tau\_{3}\in[0,M\_{\tau}], and ν∈[νmin,νmax]\nu\in[\nu\_{\min},\nu\_{\max}] for some νmin>2\nu\_{\min}>2.
2. 2.

   *Nondegenerate scales:* there exist 0<σmin<σmax<∞0<\sigma\_{\min}<\sigma\_{\max}<\infty such that σk∈[σmin,σmax]\sigma\_{k}\in[\sigma\_{\min},\sigma\_{\max}] for k=1,2,3k=1,2,3.
3. 3.

   *Volume-range control (design-dependent):* for the realized design v1:Tv\_{1:T}, the implied scales satisfy

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | 0<smin,T≤sk​(vt;θk)≤smax,T<∞for all ​t≤T,k∈{1,2,3},θ∈Θ,0<s\_{\min,T}\leq s\_{k}(v\_{t};\theta\_{k})\leq s\_{\max,T}<\infty\qquad\text{for all }t\leq T,\ k\in\{1,2,3\},\ \theta\in\Theta, |  |

   where smin,T,smax,Ts\_{\min,T},s\_{\max,T} may depend on v1:Tv\_{1:T} through maxt≤T⁡vt\max\_{t\leq T}v\_{t}.

Then Assumptions [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption1 "Assumption 4.1 (Compactness and continuity). ‣ 4.4.1 Regularity Conditions ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types")–[4.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption6 "Assumption 4.6 (Local Lipschitz regularity on bounded increments). ‣ 4.5.2 Local Lipschitz Regularity ‣ 4.5 Stability of Posterior Odds under Perturbations ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") and Assumption [4.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption5 "Assumption 4.5 (Moment control for increments). ‣ 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") hold (with constants allowed to depend on the realized design through smin,T,smax,Ts\_{\min,T},s\_{\max,T}).

###### Proof sketch.

Compactness and continuity follow because the Gaussian and Student-tt densities are continuous in their parameters and strictly positive on ℝ\mathbb{R}, and the softmax gating is continuous in (v,θ)(v,\theta) on bounded parameter sets.

The envelope condition follows from standard bounds on Gaussian and Student-tt log-densities: on any fixed design and under nondegenerate scales, there exist constants c0,c1<∞c\_{0},c\_{1}<\infty such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | supy,θ,t|logfy(x∣vt,θ)|≤c0+c1x2,\sup\_{y,\theta,t}\big|\log f\_{y}(x\mid v\_{t},\theta)\big|\leq c\_{0}+c\_{1}x^{2}, |  |

and x↦c0+c1​x2x\mapsto c\_{0}+c\_{1}x^{2} is integrable under the true law because Gaussian and Student-tt components have finite second moments when νmin>2\nu\_{\min}>2.

Assumption [4.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption5 "Assumption 4.5 (Moment control for increments). ‣ 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") holds for any q<νminq<\nu\_{\min}, since the qq-th moment of a Student-tνt\_{\nu} distribution is finite iff ν>q\nu>q, and Gaussian moments are finite of all orders.

Local Lipschitz in xx on [−R,R][-R,R] follows by bounding derivatives of log⁡fy​(x∣v,θ)\log f\_{y}(x\mid v,\theta): for each location–scale component, ∂xlog⁡f\partial\_{x}\log f is affine in xx divided by s2s^{2}, hence bounded on [−R,R][-R,R] when ss is bounded away from zero; mixture derivatives can be bounded by convexity using the component-wise bounds.
∎

#### A.6 Extension to dependent increments

We record a standard extension showing how concentration statements adapt when increments are not conditionally independent but remain “well-behaved” in a martingale sense.

###### Proposition A.2 (Martingale-difference extension (sketch)).

Suppose (Δ​Xt)t≤T(\Delta X\_{t})\_{t\leq T} is adapted to a filtration (ℱt)(\mathcal{F}\_{t}), and conditional on (Y,θ)(Y,\theta) satisfies a martingale-difference structure under the true law:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[Δ​Xt∣ℱt−1,Y=y⋆,θ=θ⋆]=my⋆​(vt;θ⋆),\mathbb{E}[\Delta X\_{t}\mid\mathcal{F}\_{t-1},Y=y^{\star},\theta=\theta^{\star}]=m\_{y^{\star}}(v\_{t};\theta^{\star}), |  |

with increments uniformly bounded on a truncation event ERE\_{R} as in Assumption [4.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmassumption6 "Assumption 4.6 (Local Lipschitz regularity on bounded increments). ‣ 4.5.2 Local Lipschitz Regularity ‣ 4.5 Stability of Posterior Odds under Perturbations ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") and Proposition [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmproposition2 "Proposition 4.2 (Finite-sample posterior error bound (robust form)). ‣ 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types").
Then exponential error bounds analogous to Proposition [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.18815v1#S4.Thmproposition2 "Proposition 4.2 (Finite-sample posterior error bound (robust form)). ‣ 4.4.4 Finite-Sample Error Bounds via Truncation ‣ 4.4 Posterior Concentration and Finite-Sample Error Bounds ‣ 4 Inverse-Problem Analysis: Identifiability, Concentration, Stability, and Information Gain ‣ Prediction Markets as Bayesian Inverse Problems: Uncertainty Quantification, Identifiability, and Information Gain from Price–Volume Histories under Latent Types") follow by replacing Hoeffding inequalities with Azuma–Hoeffding inequalities for martingales.

###### Proof sketch.

The key object is again the log Bayes factor written as a sum of one-step predictive log-likelihood ratios; these form a martingale with bounded increments on ERE\_{R}. Azuma–Hoeffding yields exponential deviation bounds around the (conditional) expectation, and the deterministic KL-gap lower bounds enter as in the independent case once one controls the conditional expectations via a tower property.
