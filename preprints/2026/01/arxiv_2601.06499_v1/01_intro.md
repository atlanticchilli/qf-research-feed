###### Abstract

Current asset pricing research exhibits a significant gap: a lack of sufficient cross-market validation regarding short-term trading-based factors. Against this backdrop, the development of the Chinese A-share market—which is characterized by its retail-investor dominance, policy sensitivity, and high-frequency active trading has given rise to specific short-term trading-based factors. This study systematically examines the universality of factors from the Alpha191 library in the U.S. market, addressing the challenge of high-dimensional factor screening through the double-selection LASSO algorithm—an established method for cross-market, high-dimensional research. After controlling for 151 fundamental factors from the U.S. equity factor zoo, 17 Alpha191 factors selected by this procedure exhibit significant incremental explanatory power for the cross-section of U.S. stock returns at the 5% level. Together these findings demonstrate that short-term trading-based factors, originating from the unique structure of the chinese A-share market, provide incremental information not captured by existing mainstream pricing models, thereby enhancing the explanation of cross-sectional return differences.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), developed by [[46](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib17 "Capital asset prices: a theory of market equilibrium under conditions of risk")] and [[42](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib18 "The valuation of risk assets and the selection of risky investments in stock portfolios and capital budgets")], laid the foundation of modern asset pricing by relating expected returns to market beta. Yet, its single-factor structure proved insufficient for explaining cross-sectional return variation. In response, the literature evolved from the three-factor model [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib4 "Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds")] to the contemporary five-factor framework [[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib5 "A five-factor asset pricing model")]. However, this evolution has led to a ”factor zoo” of hundreds of candidate variables, raising significant concerns regarding data mining and statistical validity [[26](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib10 "… And the cross-section of expected returns")]. This motivates the need for rigorous, high-dimensional selection methods capable of identifying genuine alpha from redundant noise.

While comprehensive meta-studies such as [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib15 "Is there a replication crisis in finance?")] document a vast ”factor zoo,” the literature remains heavily skewed toward fundamental anomalies rooted in slow-moving, low-frequency accounting data. These value-based factors, while structurally sound, often rely on infrequent financial reporting and fail to capture real-time market shifts or sentiment-driven volatility [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib3 "The cross-section of expected stock returns")]. This leaves high-frequency, trading-based signals—which capture the fast dynamics of market participants—under-represented in dominant pricing models. Although purely trading-based signals are sometimes criticized for lacking fundamental grounding [[25](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib9 "It’s all in the timing: simple active factor strategies")], integrating their short-term agility with traditional fundamental stability offers a more robust framework for explaining cross-sectional returns. Our study addresses this by testing whether these fast signals possess universal explanatory power that persists even after controlling for the ’slow’ factors of the established US factor zoo.

To identify these short-term signals, we look to the Chinese A-share market as an instructive laboratory for behavioral trading patterns. This environment is characterized by a unique investor structure; according to CSDC (China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation) annual reports, retail investors account for approximately 60% of trading volume—a demographic frequently associated in literature with sentiment-driven activity. It is within this high-velocity context that the Alpha191 library was developed to systematically catalog price-volume and order-flow signals. Rather than viewing these factors as idiosyncratic to their market of origin, we treat them as a concentrated set of fast indicators designed to capture latent behavioral dynamics. This study tests whether these signals, refined in a high-turnover environment with pronounced retail participation, possess incremental explanatory power when applied to the more mature, institutionalized U.S. market.

In order to navigate this high-dimensional library, we categorize the 191 factors into six primary thematic domains: Volume & Flow (order-flow conviction), Mean Reversion (overextension recovery), Trend & Momentum (directional persistence), Volatility & Risk (uncertainty pricing), Liquidity & VWAP (execution and cost-of-trade dynamics), and Price Action (high-frequency patterns). While many factors in the library are mathematically complex and could arguably span multiple categories, this classification serves as a structured heuristic to better understand the economic mechanisms driving the signals. By deconstructing the library through these thematic pillars, we can evaluate which specific dimensions of short-term behavior translate most effectively from the Chinese to the U.S. market.

This transition rests on the hypothesis of behavioral universality. Although market structures differ, the psychological biases driving overreaction, herding, and liquidity-seeking are viewed as fundamental cognitive traits common to all market participants [[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib63 "Investor psychology and asset pricing"), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib64 "Investor psychology and security market under- and overreactions")]. While existing U.S. literature already acknowledges short-term anomalies such as one-month reversals [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib13 "Returns to buying winners and selling losers: implications for stock market efficiency")] and idiosyncratic volatility [[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib40 "The cross-section of volatility and expected returns")], these are often treated as isolated phenomena. By testing the Alpha191 library on the S&P 500, we examine whether a high-dimensional set of trading signals provides a more comprehensive description of fast dynamics than traditional U.S. proxies. This serves as a stringency test: if factors designed for a retail-dominated market survive in the world’s most efficient equity market, they likely capture universal dynamics that traditional fundamental models overlook.

To address this, we employ a double-selection (DS) LASSO framework [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib11 "Taming the factor zoo: a test of new factors")], which allows for a principled estimation of a factor’s marginal contribution while mitigating selection bias. By using 153 canonical factors from [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib15 "Is there a replication crisis in finance?")] as our control universe, we set an intentionally high bar to ensure that any surviving Alpha191 signal provides non-redundant information beyond existing linear benchmarks. Our study makes three primary contributions: first, we quantify the economic significance of these factors by estimating their risk premiums relative to the established U.S. factor zoo; second, we investigate signal persistence across various portfolio sorting granularities to test the robustness of the cross-sectional returns; and third, we benchmark the DS-LASSO against alternative estimators, such as Elastic Net and PCA, to ensure the stability of our factor selection.

Asset pricing research has developed a sophisticated framework for factor selection and model design, largely grounded in U.S. market evidence and shaped by seminal contributions such as [[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib16 "The capital asset pricing model: some empirical tests")], [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib19 "Risk, return, and equilibrium: empirical tests")], [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib20 "The variation of economic risk premiums")], [[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib21 "The conditional capm and the cross-section of expected returns")], [[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib22 "A comprehensive look at the empirical performance of equity premium prediction")], and [[40](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib23 "The cross-section of expected stock returns")]. While these foundations rely on asymptotic inference and linear tools like PCA and LASSO, the literature has evolved toward more flexible frameworks—e.g., [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib24 "Efficient estimation of a semiparametric characteristic-based factor model of security returns")], [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib25 "Time-varying risk premium in large cross-sectional equity datasets")], [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib26 "Inference on risk premia in the presence of omitted factors")], [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib11 "Taming the factor zoo: a test of new factors")]—to improve robustness against selection bias and omitted variables. This evolution has been prompted by a massive expansion of the ”factor zoo,” ranging from consumption-based models [[9](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib27 "An intertemporal asset pricing model with stochastic consumption and investment opportunities")] and macroeconomic factors [[10](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib28 "Economic forces and the stock market"), [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib29 "Resurrecting the (c) capm: a cross-sectional test when risk premia are time-varying")] to liquidity [[44](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib30 "Liquidity risk and expected stock returns")] and intermediary capital [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib31 "Financial intermediaries and the cross-section of asset returns"), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib32 "Intermediary asset pricing")]. Despite this proliferation, empirical challenges to the CAPM—including anomalies like leverage [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib36 "Debt/equity ratio and expected common stock returns: empirical evidence")], momentum [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib13 "Returns to buying winners and selling losers: implications for stock market efficiency")], and idiosyncratic volatility [[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib40 "The cross-section of volatility and expected returns")]—have come under intense scrutiny. Studies such as [[30](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib41 "Replicating anomalies")], [[26](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib10 "… And the cross-section of expected returns")], [[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib42 "Reports of value’s death may be greatly exaggerated")], and [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib43 "Anomalies and false rejections")] demonstrate that many published factors fail to survive stricter statistical thresholds, highlighting the need for dimensionality reduction and more robust inference. Within this context, a specialized subfield has focused on high-frequency trading factors and short-term price dynamics. While traditional momentum and long-term reversals [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib59 "Does the stock market overreact?")] are well-documented, recent US-centric research highlights the importance of short-term reversals and intraday patterns [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib60 "Evaporating liquidity"), [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib61 "Intraday patterns in the cross-section of stock returns")]. Furthermore, the role of volume in confirming price signals finds roots in US literature through [[7](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib62 "Market statistics and technical analysis: the role of volume")], which demonstrates that volume contains information orthogonal to price. These ”trading-based” signals capture behavioral ”footprints”—such as overreaction or liquidity seeking—that differ fundamentally from accounting-based anomalies. Modern research increasingly employs high-dimensional methods—including PLS, IPCA, and regularization—to overcome these stability challenges [[45](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib44 "Forecasting stock returns"), [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib45 "Firm characteristics and chinese stocks"), [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib46 "Constructing optimal sparse portfolios using regularization methods"), [35](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib47 "Dissecting characteristics nonparametrically"), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib48 "Sparse signals in the cross-section of returns"), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib49 "Aggregation of information about the cross section of stock returns: a latent variable approach"), [37](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib50 "Shrinking the cross-section"), [36](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib51 "Characteristics are covariances: a unified model of risk and return"), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib52 "Empirical asset pricing via machine learning")]. Among these, the DS-LASSO of [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib11 "Taming the factor zoo: a test of new factors")] provides a rigorous solution for evaluating factor validity by mitigating model misspecification. Our paper contributes to this frontier by bridging the gap between slow fundamental anomalies and fast trading signals. By combining the Alpha191 library with the comprehensive fundamental dataset of [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib15 "Is there a replication crisis in finance?")], we apply a DS-LASSO framework to evaluate whether these short-horizon signals offer genuine incremental value in the world’s most efficient equity market.

## 1 Methodology

Modern asset pricing research faces two intertwined challenges: high-dimensional factor sets and the risk of omitted variable bias (OVB). Traditional low-dimensional models often fail to capture the true cross-sectional determinants of returns, leading to biased coefficient estimates whose sign and magnitude may be indeterminate. The problem is exacerbated in contemporary factor libraries, which can contain hundreds of candidate variables, many of which are highly correlated. Conventional linear regression or single-step LASSO struggles under such conditions, either omitting relevant factors or including redundant ones, and thus producing unreliable inference [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib12 "Inference on treatment effects after selection among high-dimensional controls"), [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib46 "Constructing optimal sparse portfolios using regularization methods")].

To address these challenges, this study builds upon the DS-LASSO framework introduced by [[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib12 "Inference on treatment effects after selection among high-dimensional controls"), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib11 "Taming the factor zoo: a test of new factors")]. While our numerical implementation is tailored to the specific characteristics of the Alpha191 signal library, it remains conceptually grounded in their two-stage selection procedure. This method systematically reduces factor dimensionality while mitigating OVB, providing valid post-selection inference even in high-dimensional settings. Its core advantage lies in a two-stage selection procedure: the first stage identifies factors with strong explanatory power; the second stage screens for potentially omitted confounders correlated with either the target or outcome variables. This approach ensures that both relevant predictors and weak but important confounders are retained, thereby improving both estimation accuracy and interpretability.

In the original specification, the first-stage cross-sectional LASSO regression estimates factor loadings by minimizing a penalized least-squares objective:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | minγ,λ⁡{n−1​‖r¯−ιn​γ−Cov^​(𝒓t,𝒉t)​λ‖2+τ0​n−1​‖λ‖1}\min\_{\gamma,\lambda}\left\{n^{-1}\left\|\bar{r}-\iota\_{n}\gamma-\widehat{\mathrm{Cov}}\left(\boldsymbol{r}\_{t},\boldsymbol{h}\_{t}\right)\lambda\right\|^{2}+\tau\_{0}n^{-1}\|\lambda\|\_{1}\right\} |  | (1) |

Here, r¯\bar{r} is the time-series mean vector of stock returns and ιn​γ\iota\_{n}\gamma represents a common intercept across assets, where ιn\iota\_{n} is a vector of ones and γ\gamma denotes the zero-beta rate. Further, Cov^​(𝒓t,𝒉t)\widehat{\mathrm{Cov}}\left(\boldsymbol{r}\_{t},\boldsymbol{h}\_{t}\right) is the sample covariance between initial, i.e. control pricing factors and returns, nn the sample size, and τ0\tau\_{0} the regularization parameter. Factors with non-zero λ^i\hat{\lambda}\_{i} coefficients are retained as effective factors in set {I1}\{I\_{1}\}, these factors cross-sectionally drive returns; the other factors are eliminated.

The second-stage LASSO regression addresses potential OVB by regressing each candidate test factor on the selected initial factors:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | minξj,χj,i⁡{n−1​‖Cov^​(𝒓t,𝒈t,j)−ιn​ξj−Cov^​(𝒓t,𝒉t)​χj,i⊤‖2+τ1​j​n−1​‖χj,i⊤‖1}\min\_{\xi\_{j},\chi\_{j,i}}\left\{n^{-1}\left\|\widehat{\mathrm{Cov}}\left(\boldsymbol{r}\_{t},\boldsymbol{g}\_{t,j}\right)-\iota\_{n}\xi\_{j}-\widehat{\mathrm{Cov}}\left(\boldsymbol{r}\_{t},\boldsymbol{h}\_{t}\right)\chi\_{j,i}^{\top}\right\|^{2}+\tau\_{1j}n^{-1}\|\chi\_{j,i}^{\top}\|\_{1}\right\} |  | (2) |

where i=1,…,pi=1,\dots,p indexes initial factors and j=1,…,dj=1,\dots,d indexes test factors. Non-zero χj,i^\widehat{\chi\_{j,i}} coefficients identify additional valid factors, collected in set {I2}\{I\_{2}\}. This stage aims to pick up factors that might not be strong enough to drive returns, but are highly correlated with the test factors. Finally, the union {I1∪I2}\{I\_{1}\cup I\_{2}\} forms the set of predictors used in an OLS regression to explain cross-sectional expected returns. This ensures that both strong and weak but relevant confounders are included in the model:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (γ0^,λh^,λg^)=arg⁡minγ0,λh,λg⁡{‖r¯−ιn​γ0−λh​Cov^​(𝒓t,𝒉t)−Cov^​(𝒓t,𝒈t)​λg‖2:λh,i=0,∀j∉I1∪I2}\left(\widehat{\gamma\_{0}},\widehat{\lambda\_{h}},\widehat{\lambda\_{g}}\right)=\arg\min\_{\gamma\_{0},\lambda\_{h},\lambda\_{g}}\left\{\left\|\bar{r}-\iota\_{n}\gamma\_{0}-\lambda\_{h}\widehat{\mathrm{Cov}}\left(\boldsymbol{r}\_{t},\boldsymbol{h}\_{t}\right)-\widehat{\mathrm{Cov}}\left(\boldsymbol{r}\_{t},\boldsymbol{g}\_{t}\right)\lambda\_{g}\right\|^{2}:\lambda\_{h,i}=0,\forall j\notin I\_{1}\cup I\_{2}\right\} |  | (3) |

Significant λg^\widehat{\lambda\_{g}} values indicate that a candidate factor provides incremental explanatory power beyond the initial set.

In our empirical execution, we maintain the structural integrity of the equations above with minor adaptations for numerical stability. First, we treat the intercept γ\gamma in the selection stages (Eq. [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#S1.E1 "In 1 Methodology ‣ Cross-Market Alpha: Testing Short-Term Trading Factors in the U.S. Market via Double-Selection LASSO") and [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#S1.E2 "In 1 Methodology ‣ Cross-Market Alpha: Testing Short-Term Trading Factors in the U.S. Market via Double-Selection LASSO")) as an unpenalized nuisance parameter. By allowing the intercept to absorb the common level of returns without shrinkage, we ensure that the LASSO selection is driven strictly by the cross-sectional covariance structure of the signals rather than the absolute magnitude of the zero-beta rate. Additionally, in the joint inference stage (Eq. [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#S1.E3 "In 1 Methodology ‣ Cross-Market Alpha: Testing Short-Term Trading Factors in the U.S. Market via Double-Selection LASSO")), we explicitly include a constant term and utilize the HC3 robust covariance estimator. Regularization parameters τ0\tau\_{0} and τ1​j\tau\_{1j} are calibrated via kk-fold cross-validation. To prioritize model parsimony and further mitigate the risk of overfitting in a high-dimensional p>np>n environment, we employ the 1-SE rule. Rather than selecting the regularization strength that yields the absolute minimum mean squared error (MSE), we choose the most restrictive penalty τ\tau that remains within one standard error of the minimum MSE. This approach ensures optimal sparsity by selecting the most conservative factor set that retains essentially the same predictive power as the unconstrained minimum, thereby enhancing the out-of-sample stability of the surviving Alpha191 signals.

Compared to single-step LASSO, DS-LASSO effectively addresses three challenges: high dimensionality, factor redundancy, and OVB [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib11 "Taming the factor zoo: a test of new factors")]. Its two-stage approach maximizes the probability of retaining relevant confounders regardless of their correlation patterns with the test factors. This also provides strong theoretical guarantees: under sparsity conditions, the estimator is consistent, asymptotically unbiased, and allows valid inference.

While alternative machine learning methods such as Elastic Net or PCA can handle high-dimensional data, they either obscure individual factor interpretation or fail to provide reliable causal inference [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib58 "Factors that fit the time series and cross-section of stock returns"), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib52 "Empirical asset pricing via machine learning")]. PCA aggregates variables into latent components, weakening the explanatory power of individual factors. Forward stepwise or single-equation LASSO may miss weak confounders entirely. DS-LASSO, by contrast, balances interpretability, robust factor selection, and valid inference, making it the preferred method for evaluating factor contributions in high-dimensional asset pricing contexts.

## 2 Empirical Analysis

The empirical analysis in this study is conducted using Python 3.12.0 and the scikit-learn library (version 1.7.1) on a machine equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7840HS CPU and 32GB of RAM. The specific Python environment and package versions are documented to ensure full reproducibility. Hyperparameters for LASSO regression, particularly the regularization strength, are selected via LassoCV with 200 candidate alphas along the regularization path, a 10-fold cross-validation, and an epsilon of 0.05 to finely explore the critical range of regularization values. The final selection of factors is based on the 1-SE rule to balance sparsity with predictive accuracy and to avoid overfitting.

The analysis uses two primary datasets. The factor zoo dataset ([[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib15 "Is there a replication crisis in finance?")]) consists of 4,135,225 observations with 444 characteristics and serves as the basis for fundamental factor calculations. The Alpha191 factor set is derived from S&P 500 constituent data from the OptionMetrics IvyDB, spanning from 2002 to 2022, containing 4,917,327 observations for prices and volumes. We preprocess the data: duplicates are removed and negative or logically impossible values are excluded. Additional filtering includes retaining only records from the CRSP database, excluding non-common equity securities, limiting to stocks on NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ, and removing penny stocks priced below $5.

Of the original 191 Alpha factors, 23 were excluded prior to analysis due to unreliable or unstable time series signals. These factors produced excessive missing values or exhibited numerical instability in rolling calculations, making them unsuitable for portfolio construction and regression analysis. The remaining 168 Alpha factors are used for empirical evaluation. The corresponding Alpha191 single stock level signals are computed using a 252-day rolling window to capture relevant market dynamics while avoiding noise from obsolete long-term patterns. Stocks with incomplete data in the rolling window are excluded.

Alpha factor construction follows a monthly rebalancing scheme. For each factor, daily signals are computed and used to form value-weighted high-minus-low decile portfolios based on firm market capitalization. Daily long–short returns are then aggregated to the monthly level by computing the mean of daily returns and scaling by 21 to approximate the monthly return. Test assets constructed from the Alpha191 factors are based on a bivariate independent sort and include the first 3×23\times 2 (size ×\times factor) portfolios, with extensions to 5×55\times 5 portfolios. For Jensen factors and their corresponding test assets, only monthly data are available. In these cases, lagged firm characteristics and market capitalizations are used to construct value-weighted high-minus-low decile portfolios, and no daily-to-monthly scaling is applied since returns are already measured at the monthly frequency. The decision to aggregate daily Alpha factor returns by scaling rather than directly constructing monthly returns is deliberate. Alpha factors are trading-based in nature and are designed to exploit short-horizon return predictability embedded in high-frequency signals. Aggregating daily returns preserves information about intra-month trading intensity and volatility that would be obscured if only end-of-month returns were used. In contrast, a direct monthly return construction would implicitly average over heterogeneous daily dynamics and understate the effective risk exposure of actively traded strategies. Scaling the mean daily return by 21 therefore yields a monthly return measure that is consistent with the economic scale of continuous trading strategies and aligns the return magnitude with the covariance-based pricing framework. Jensen factors, by contrast, are defined at the monthly frequency and reflect slower-moving economic risks, making daily aggregation neither feasible nor economically meaningful. Consequently, while the construction methods differ based on the underlying data availability, all factors and test assets are ultimately standardized to a monthly frequency for use in the empirical algorithms.

All factor and test asset portfolios are constructed using S&P 500 constituent stocks on the exact dates of monthly rebalancing. Test assets additionally include all current and former SPX constituents over the full sample period to ensure comprehensive coverage. For characteristics that take on discrete values with many ties, such as firm age in years, overlapping bins are used during portfolio sorting to ensure that each portfolio contains sufficient observations and to maintain balanced group sizes. The 3×23\times 2 exercise produces 1008 Alpha factor portfolios and 918 Jensen portfolios, for a total of 1926 test assets. The later 5×55\times 5 exercise results in 4200 Alpha and 3825 Jensen portfolios, totaling 8025 assets, though these results are discussed in subsequent sections. Portfolio returns are computed as monthly value-weighted returns and serve as the dependent variables in the regression analyses.

Our empirical evaluation employs the DS-LASSO framework: In Stage 1, mean portfolio returns are regressed on the full set of traditional equity factor covariances using LASSO, selecting a sparse subset of core return drivers (I1I\_{1}). Stage 2 then regresses the covariances of each Alpha191 factor (gg) with portfolio returns on the full set of traditional factor covariances, identifying an additional subset of controls whose exposures are predictive of the alpha factor loadings. Importantly, Stage 2 is conducted over the full control universe rather than the Stage-1-selected subset, ensuring that controls are relevant for explaining factor exposures are not omitted. The union of all Stage 2-selected factors across the Alpha191 set forms the secondary control set (I2I\_{2}). Finally, Stage 3 performs an OLS regression of portfolio mean returns on the combined Stage 1 and Stage 2 factors (I1∪I2I\_{1}\cup I\_{2}) along with the full Alpha191 factor set (gg) to assess incremental explanatory power. Heteroscedasticity-robust HC3 standard errors are used for t-statistics to account for the cross-sectional structure of the regression and the finite number of observations used to compute mean returns and covariances, ensuring consistent and reliable inference.

Table LABEL:tab:3x2\_DS\_SS\_results presents the regression results for the 3×23\times 2 portfolios. Column (1) reports the DS results, while column (2) reports single-selection (SS) LASSO estimates. Of the 168 Alpha191 factors retained after removing discontinuous variables, 17 factors survive the DS procedure with a tt-statistic exceeding 2.0. The SS estimates, in contrast, often differ substantially in both magnitude and sign, reflecting the sensitivity of SS LASSO to the joint inclusion of all alphas without the sequential control selection implemented in DS.

The reported *risk premium* values, λs\lambda\_{s}, correspond to the incremental expected return associated with each factor after controlling for the selected set of traditional equity factors. These coefficients are estimated from the final OLS regression on the standardized covariances between portfolio returns and factor returns. Because each factor is scaled to unit variance, the covariances effectively act as betas, and λs\lambda\_{s} represents the expected return contribution per one-standard-deviation exposure. This interpretation allows for a direct comparison of factor importance across the selected Alpha191 signals.

The regression results presented in Table LABEL:tab:3x2\_DS\_SS\_results illustrate a significant divergence between the Double-Selection (DS) and Single-Selection (SS) methodologies, with 17 Alpha191 factors surviving the DS procedure with t-statistics exceeding 2.0. A primary finding is the extreme coefficient instability inherent in the SS estimates; many factors that appear robust under DS exhibit sign reversals or a total loss of statistical significance in the SS column. This instability highlights the susceptibility of standard LASSO to high-dimensional multicollinearity, whereas the DS procedure’s sequential control selection successfully isolates the incremental contribution of each alpha. The surviving factors display distinct thematic clustering, primarily centered on volume-price interactions, short-term mean reversion, and volatility-risk metrics. Specifically, indicators such as the 20-Day Cumulative On-Balance Volume (084) and the Price-Volume vs. Low-Volume Correlation Rank (123) suggest that liquidity demand footprints are universal drivers of cross-sectional returns. Furthermore, the significance of mean-reversion signals like the Multi-Period Mean Reversion Ratio (046) and the 24-Day Percentage Deviation from Mean (071) indicates that price extensions generate tradable corrections not captured by traditional fundamental factors like Book-to-Market (HML). The notable retention of Volatility & Risk factors, including Benchmark-Relative Excess Return Skewness (181) and the 12-Day Average True Range (161), further demonstrates that the Alpha191 library effectively captures risk premia associated with non-linear return distributions. Conversely, the scarcity of significant spread-specific factors suggests that while behavioral patterns like overreaction are cross-market universal, microstructural signals related to specific trading regimes may be too idiosyncratic to the A-share market to provide incremental value in the institutionalized U.S. context.

Robustness is assessed through alternative portfolio constructions and machine learning methods. 5×55\times 5 portfolios are formed to increase granularity, providing a stricter test of the two-stage LASSO procedure, as shown in Table LABEL:tab:Results\_Robustness

The transition from 3×2 to 5×5 portfolio construction reveals a substantial expansion in the set of surviving Alpha191 factors, providing empirical evidence for the signal dilution hypothesis. While the 3×2 sort serves as a robust baseline, its coarse partitioning tends to average the returns of extreme-signal stocks with those closer to the mean, thereby smoothing over the idiosyncratic signals characteristic of high-frequency trading alphas. By increasing granularity to a 5×5 bivariate sort, the analysis isolates the top and bottom quintiles where behavioral biases and liquidity shocks are theoretically most pronounced. Economically, the results in the 5×5 setting maintain the thematic consistency observed in the 3×2 exercise—specifically the relevance of Volume-Price interactions and Mean Reversion—but also allow for the emergence of ”Tail-Sensitivity” factors. These include complex rank-correlations such as the Inverse Rank of High-Price and Volume Correlation (141) and the Inverse Rank of Close-Volume Rank Covariance (099), which achieve statistical significance only when the tails of the distribution are specifically targeted. Furthermore, the 5×5 construction uncovers a broader range of short-term trend and momentum signals, exemplified by the high t-statistics for the Rank of Delayed Price-Gap Correlation (184) and the Overnight Gap Return (015). These findings suggest that while core Alpha191 signals possess a degree of market-wide pervasiveness, a secondary layer of trading factors becomes statistically visible only when partitioning the cross-section finely enough to capture extreme deviations from fundamental value. This aligns with the intuition that short-term trading alphas are most potent in the tails of the distribution where limits to arbitrage are most restrictive and behavioral footprints are deepest.

Finally, alternative dimensionality reduction methods, Elastic Net and PCA, are applied to the same factor universe to benchmark the DS-LASSO approach. The Elastic Net model runs cross-validated ElasticNetCV over multiple l1l\_{1}-ratios on the covariances, automatically selecting both the optimal l1l\_{1}-ratio and regularization strength, and refits OLS on the chosen controls plus all alphas. PCA reduces the dimensionality of the covariances by retaining components that explain 90% of variance, and OLS is performed on the resulting PCA scores along with all Alpha191 factors. These benchmark models allow comparison of factor selection, dimensionality reduction, and predictive performance against the two-stage DS-LASSO methodology.

Table 3: \*

The comparison across alternative high-dimensional models in Table LABEL:tab:3x2\_AltModels reinforces the robustness of the factors identified through the DS procedure. Within a fixed 3×2 portfolio design, the results from Elastic Net (ENet) and PCA serve as critical benchmarks for the stability of the Alpha191 signals. A central result is the broad consistency in coefficient signs and statistical significance across fundamentally different frameworks; core factors such as the Multi-Period Mean Reversion Ratio (046) and the 24-Day Percentage Deviation from Mean (071) maintain high t-statistics in all three specifications. ENet, which utilizes joint shrinkage to handle correlated predictors, corroborates the incremental explanatory power of these alphas, though it often produces larger coefficient magnitudes compared to the two-stage DS estimates. Similarly, the PCA approach validates that factors such as the Rank of Delayed Price-Gap Correlation (184) and Benchmark-Relative Excess Return Skewness (181) capture variation that is orthogonal to the dominant common components of the control universe. The persistence of these signals across shrinkage, dimension-reduction, and sequential selection frameworks suggests that the identified alphas are not artifacts of a specific statistical specification but represent pervasive cross-sectional return drivers.

## 3 Conclusion

This study systematically investigates the cross-market relevance of short-term trading-based signals, specifically evaluating the incremental explanatory power of the China A-share ”Alpha191” library within the U.S. S&P 500 market from 2002 to 2022. By employing a DS-LASSO framework, we addressed the critical challenges of high dimensionality and OVB that frequently undermine traditional factor-testing environments. Our primary finding is that 17 of the Alpha191 factors retain statistically significant incremental explanatory power in the 3×2 portfolio construction, even after controlling for a comprehensive set of 151 fundamental factors from the established equity factor zoo [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.06499v1#bib.bib15 "Is there a replication crisis in finance?")]. The nature of these surviving factors suggests a Behavioral Universality; the most robust signals exhibit distinct thematic clustering around Volume-Price Interaction, Short-Term Mean Reversion, and Volatility-Risk metrics. This demonstrates that signals originating from a retail-dominated market like China capture fundamental biases - such as overreaction and liquidity-seeking — that remain priced even in the highly institutionalized U.S. large-cap market. This suggests that the ’factor zoo’ documented in U.S. literature is not exhaustive, but rather skewed toward slow-moving fundamental risk, leaving a significant portion of the cross-section explained by high-frequency behavioral dynamics. For an investor, the value of incorporating these alpha trading factors lies in the mitigation of model misspecification risk; by failing to consider these ’fast’ signals, an investor omits a non-redundant dimension of the return-generating process, resulting in a biased understanding of risk exposures and the loss of information that traditional ’slow’ fundamental models inherently ignore.

Our findings provide a proof-of-concept for a dual-horizon pricing framework. While the canonical U.S. factors capture long-term structural risks, the surviving Alpha191 signals capture the fast agility of market participants. The fact that 17 signals survive a high-dimensional screening against 151 controls indicates that trading-based information is not merely noise, but a distinct component of expected returns. The investigation into portfolio granularity reveals a critical signal dilution effect that informs our understanding of alpha decay. Moving from a coarse 3×2 to a granular 5×5 bivariate sort significantly expanded the set of significant factors, providing evidence that trading signals are often masked by central-tendency averaging. While the core volume and reversion signals remained significant across both specifications, the 5×5 construction allowed for the detection of tail-sensitivity factors that exploit extreme price-volume dislocations. This finding supports the intuition that short-term trading alphas are most potent in the tails of the distribution where behavioral footprints are deepest, limits to arbitrage are most restrictive, and the marginal contribution of liquidity-based signals is maximized. Methodologically, the DS-LASSO procedure proved superior to single-stage LASSO, which exhibited extreme coefficient instability and sign reversals due to high-dimensional multicollinearity and the simultaneous inclusion of redundant alphas. The benchmarking against Elastic Net and PCA further corroborated our results.

However, this study is not without limitations. The use of monthly aggregated return data likely smooths over some of the high-frequency microstructural dynamics where the trading signals are born, potentially underestimating the true predictive power of the Alpha191 library. Furthermore, our focus on the S&P 500 limits the generalizability of these findings; it is highly probable that the explanatory power of these behavioral signals would be even more pronounced in U.S. small-cap or emerging markets where retail participation is higher and liquidity is lower. The Behavioral Universality identified here may therefore represent a lower bound of the potential cross-market integration of these signals. Future research should expand this Cross-Market Alpha framework in three dimensions. First, moving toward higher-frequency data (daily or intraday) would allow researchers to capture the microstructural origins of these factors before they are attenuated by monthly averaging. Second, the Behavioral Universality hypothesis should be tested across a broader international spectrum, including European and developed Asian markets, to determine if these trading signals represent universal axioms of market behavior across varying regulatory regimes. Finally, the linear assumptions of the DS-LASSO could be benchmarked against non-linear machine learning architectures, such as Gradient Boosted Trees or Neural Networks. Such models could uncover complex interactions between fundamental slow factors and trading-based fast factors, potentially revealing a more comprehensive, dual-horizon model of the cross-section of expected returns that accounts for the non-linearities inherent in modern markets.
