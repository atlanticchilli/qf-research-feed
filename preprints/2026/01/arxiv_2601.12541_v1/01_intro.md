###### Abstract

No-arbitrage asset pricing characterizes valuation through the existence of equivalent martingale measures relative to a filtration and a class of admissible trading strategies. In practice, pricing is performed across multiple asset classes driven by economic variables that are only partially spanned by traded instruments, raising a structural question: does there exist a single admissible information structure under which all traded assets can be jointly priced as martingales?. We treat the filtration as an endogenous object constrained by admissibility and time-ordering, rather than as an exogenous primitive. For any finite collection of assets, whenever martingale pricing is feasible under some admissible filtration, it is already feasible under a canonical minimal filtration generated by the asset prices themselves; these pricing-sufficient filtrations are unique up to null sets and stable under restriction and aggregation when a common pricing measure exists. Our main result shows that this local compatibility does not extend globally: with three independent unspanned finite-variation drivers, there need not exist any admissible filtration and equivalent measure under which all assets are jointly martingales. The obstruction is sharp (absent with one driver and compatible pairwise with two) and equivalent to failure of admissible dynamic completeness. We complement the theory with numerical diagnostics based on discrete-time Doob–Meyer decompositions, illustrating how admissible information structures suppress predictable components, while inadmissible filtrations generate systematic predictability.

## 1 Introduction

The fundamental theorem of asset pricing characterizes the absence of arbitrage through the
existence of an equivalent martingale measure relative to a filtration and a notion of
admissible trading. Beginning with the seminal work of Harrison and Kreps
[harrison1979martingales] and Harrison and Pliska [harrison1981martingales], and
extended to general semimartingale models by Delbaen and Schachermayer
[delbaen1994general], this framework provides the foundation of modern
continuous-time asset pricing. A defining feature of the theory is that martingale pricing
is inherently conditional on both the information structure and the admissibility constraints
imposed on trading strategies.

In the classical formulation, the filtration is treated as an exogenous primitive. Pricing,
hedging, and questions of market completeness are studied conditional on a fixed information
structure, and market incompleteness is typically reflected in the non-uniqueness of
equivalent martingale measures
[duffie2001dynamic, karatzas1998brownian]. A large literature analyzes the implications of
this multiplicity for valuation, hedging, and risk sharing while maintaining the filtration
as given. Closely related work in the theory of enlargement of filtrations studies how
martingale and semimartingale properties change when a fixed filtration is refined
[jeulin1980semi, jeulin1985grossissements]. These approaches provide powerful tools for
analyzing information effects, but they do not address whether distinct locally valid
information structures can be made globally compatible under admissibility and
non-anticipativity.

This paper adopts a complementary perspective. Rather than taking the information structure
as fixed, we treat it as an endogenous object constrained by admissibility and time-ordering,
and ask whether there exists a single admissible filtration under which martingale pricing
can be achieved simultaneously for all admissible assets. This question is not addressed by
standard incompleteness results, which presuppose a common filtration from the outset, nor by
the enlargement-of-filtrations literature, which studies refinements of a given filtration
rather than the compatibility of distinct minimal ones.

Our analysis begins locally. For any finite group of traded assets, we show that whenever
martingale pricing is feasible under some admissible filtration, it is already feasible under
a canonical reduced filtration generated by the asset prices themselves. These
pricing-sufficient filtrations are minimal, unique up to null sets, and determined entirely
by no-arbitrage and admissibility. They support conditional risk-neutral valuation, are stable
under restriction of the asset set, and remain compatible under pairwise aggregation when a
common equivalent martingale measure exists.

The main contribution of the paper is to show that such local and pairwise compatibility does
not, in general, extend globally. Under admissibility constraints, time-ordering, and the
presence of multiple independent unspanned finite-variation drivers, there exists no
admissible filtration and no equivalent probability measure under which all asset prices are
jointly local martingales. The obstruction is sharp and minimal: with a single unspanned
driver global martingale pricing is possible; with two independent drivers pairwise
compatibility can be maintained; and failure arises for the first time with three drivers. We
further show that this non-existence result is equivalent to the failure of admissible dynamic
completeness, thereby placing the obstruction squarely within the classical no-arbitrage
framework.

To complement the theoretical analysis, the paper includes numerical illustrations in a
controlled simulated environment. These illustrations are not empirical tests. Rather, they
provide constructive diagnostics based on discrete-time Doob–Meyer decompositions, showing
how admissible information structures induce only negligible predictable finite-variation
components, while inadmissible enlargements of the filtration (violating admissibility or
time-ordering) generate systematic predictability. The simulations visualize the mechanism
underlying the theoretical obstruction and clarify why pricing-consistent conditioning cannot
be extended arbitrarily, even when additional variables appear statistically informative.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3 "3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") formalizes
admissibility and pricing-sufficient filtrations and establishes their local existence,
stability, and the main impossibility result.

for future research.

## 2 Related Literature

The results of this paper relate to several well-established strands of the literature in
mathematical finance and stochastic analysis, including the theory of no-arbitrage pricing
and equivalent martingale measures, the role of filtrations and information in asset
pricing, incomplete markets and dynamic completeness, stochastic discount factors and limits
of arbitrage, and stochastic control under partial information. While the present
contribution builds on these frameworks, it addresses a question that is not treated
directly in the existing literature: the existence and compatibility of admissible
information structures supporting martingale pricing when the filtration itself is treated
as endogenous.

The modern theory of arbitrage-free pricing characterizes asset prices through the
existence of equivalent martingale measures relative to a given filtration and a notion of
admissible trading. Foundational results were established by Harrison and Kreps
[harrison1979martingales] and Harrison and Pliska [harrison1981martingales], and
extended to general semimartingale models by Delbaen and Schachermayer
[delbaen1994general]. Comprehensive treatments of the theory and its
implications for pricing and hedging in continuous time are given in
[karatzas1998brownian, shiryaev1999essentials, duffie2001dynamic]. A common feature of
this literature is that the filtration is taken as an exogenous primitive, and questions
of pricing, hedging, and completeness are studied conditional on this fixed information
structure.

The dependence of martingale properties on information has been studied systematically in
the theory of enlargement of filtrations, initiated by Jeulin [jeulin1980semi] and
Jeulin and Yor [jeulin1985grossissements], and further developed in
[jacod1979calcul, protter2005stochastic]. This literature characterizes how
semimartingale and martingale properties are affected by progressive or initial
enlargements of a given filtration and provides conditions under which no-arbitrage,
martingale representations, and stability properties are preserved. Applications include
models with insider information, asymmetric information, and anticipation; see, for
example, [amini2016insider, imkeller2013enlargement]. The present paper differs
fundamentally in perspective. Rather than studying refinements of a fixed filtration, we
study whether there exists any admissible filtration that can simultaneously support
martingale pricing for multiple asset groups whose locally pricing-sufficient filtrations
may be incompatible. The obstruction identified here does not arise from a particular
enlargement procedure, but from the non-existence of a common admissible refinement.

A closely related strand of the literature concerns incomplete markets and the resulting
non-uniqueness of equivalent martingale measures
[harrison1981martingales]. In such settings, incompleteness is usually
attributed to insufficient spanning of sources of uncertainty by traded assets. A large
body of work studies pricing and hedging under this multiplicity, including
super-replication [delbaen2002coherent], utility-based and indifference pricing
[hodges1989optimal, carmona2009indifference], and convex risk-measure approaches
[follmer2002convex, delbaen2002coherent]; see also [frittelli2004risk] for links
between pricing and risk measures. In contrast, the present paper does not fix a filtration
and then analyze multiplicity of martingale measures within it. Instead, it shows that
under admissibility and time-ordering, the relevant filtration itself may be asset-dependent,
and failure of global martingale pricing may result from incompatibility between locally
pricing-sufficient filtrations even when local and pairwise martingale measures exist.

The paper also connects to the literature on dynamic completeness, spanning, and the
martingale representation property. Under a fixed filtration, classical results link
(dynamic) completeness to uniqueness of equivalent martingale measures and to the ability
to replicate contingent claims; see, for example, [karatzas1998brownian, duffie2001dynamic]
and the martingale representation discussion in [revuz1999continuous]. More generally,
completeness in diffusion models is characterized by rank conditions on volatility
coefficients and related spanning criteria [karatzas1991martingale, oksendal2003stochastic].
The present paper complements this literature by isolating an obstruction that arises even
prior to questions of uniqueness: admissibility and time-ordering may prevent the existence
of any single filtration under which global martingale pricing holds, and we show that this
is equivalent to failure of *admissible* dynamic completeness.

A further related literature studies stochastic discount factors (state-price deflators) and
limits of arbitrage. The representation of asset prices by stochastic discount factors is
standard in both discrete and continuous time; see, e.g., [duffie2001dynamic, cochrane2005asset].
However, existence, characterization, and aggregation of such kernels depend delicately on
admissibility, market frictions, and segmentation. Classic discussions of limits to
arbitrage and segmentation include [shleifer1997limits] and [gromb2002limits], while
models emphasizing funding and intermediation constraints include [brunnermeier2009market]
and [he2012intermediary]. Demand-based and segmented-market pricing mechanisms that
produce asset-class-specific kernels are studied in [garleanu2011demand].
Our results are orthogonal to equilibrium modeling: the obstruction identified here arises
within the no-arbitrage framework before specifying preferences, market clearing, or
institutional microstructure, and it provides a structural explanation for why
asset-class-specific pricing kernels can persist even absent explicit segmentation assumptions.

Finally, the analysis is related to the literature on stochastic control and filtering under
partial information, where agents optimize dynamically using noisy or incomplete observations.
Classical references include [liptser1977statistics, elliott1997hidden] and treatments in
continuous-time control include [pham2009continuous]. In these models, the filtration is
fixed ex ante and filtering theory is used to construct sufficient statistics for
optimization or equilibrium analysis. The present paper addresses a different question: it
characterizes which information structures are admissible for martingale pricing itself,
independently of optimization objectives or equilibrium beliefs.

Taken together, the contribution of this paper can be viewed as clarifying a gap between
existing frameworks. The filtration enlargement literature studies refinements of a given
information structure [jeulin1980semi, jeulin1985grossissements]; the incomplete markets
literature studies multiplicity of pricing measures under a fixed filtration
[duffie2001dynamic]; the dynamic completeness literature studies spanning
relative to a fixed information set [karatzas1998brownian]; and the partial information
literature studies decision making under exogenously specified information constraints
[liptser1977statistics, elliott1997hidden]. In contrast, this paper studies the
existence and compatibility of admissible information structures supporting martingale
pricing. The main result shows that under admissibility and time-ordering constraints, such
structures need not admit a global refinement, and that this failure is equivalent to the
failure of admissible dynamic completeness. This places the obstruction within the
classical theory of arbitrage-free pricing while isolating a structural limitation that is
not made explicit when the filtration is treated as fixed.

## 3 Main Results

### 3.1 Information Structures, Admissibility, and Martingale Pricing

We work on a filtered probability space
(Ω,ℱ,(ℱt)t≥0,ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}\_{t})\_{t\geq 0},\mathbb{P})
satisfying the usual conditions.
All processes are assumed to be càdlàg and adapted to the filtration under consideration.
Time is continuous and trading is frictionless except for admissibility constraints.

An asset price process S=(S1,…,Sd)S=(S^{1},\dots,S^{d}) is a vector-valued semimartingale representing
discounted prices.
Trading strategies are predictable processes integrable with respect to SS, and
portfolio value processes are defined in the usual self-financing sense.
Portfolios are introduced only to define admissible trading strategies; throughout the
paper, martingale properties are imposed on asset prices themselves.
A trading strategy is said to be admissible if the corresponding value process is bounded
from below by a constant.
This notion of admissibility is standard in continuous-time asset pricing and ensures the
exclusion of doubling strategies.

A probability measure ℚ\mathbb{Q} equivalent to ℙ\mathbb{P} is called an equivalent local
martingale measure for SS relative to a filtration 𝔾\mathbb{G} if SS is a local
martingale under ℚ\mathbb{Q} with respect to 𝔾\mathbb{G}.
The absence of arbitrage of the first kind is characterized by the existence of at least
one such measure under suitable conditions.
Throughout the paper, admissibility and the choice of filtration are treated as binding
constraints.

Crucially, the filtration is not assumed to be fixed ex ante.
Instead, we allow the relevant information structure to depend on the asset group under
consideration.
Given a finite collection of asset prices SA:=(Si)i∈AS^{A}:=(S^{i})\_{i\in A}, we define a filtration
𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} to be pricing-sufficient for SAS^{A} if there exists an equivalent local
martingale measure for SAS^{A} relative to 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A}, and if 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} is minimal
with this property in the sense that any strictly smaller subfiltration fails to support
martingale pricing of SAS^{A}.

###### Remark 3.1 (Asset groups and martingale pricing).

An asset group AA is a finite index set of traded assets.
Martingale pricing of SAS^{A} is always meant componentwise: each individual asset price
SiS^{i}, i∈Ai\in A, is a local martingale under the same filtration and probability measure.

Such filtrations are well defined under mild regularity conditions.
In particular, the collection of all equivalent local martingale measures pricing SAS^{A}
induces a minimal sufficient filtration in the classical sense of probability theory.
This filtration is unique up to ℙ\mathbb{P}-null sets and is determined entirely by
no-arbitrage and admissibility.
We refer to 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} as the minimal pricing-sufficient filtration for the asset group
AA.

Within a pricing-sufficient filtration, asset prices admit conditional martingale
representations, and standard results on martingale orthogonality and representation
apply.
In particular, conditional dependencies between asset returns are screened off by the
underlying sources of randomness captured by the filtration.
This local closure property is stable under restriction of the asset set and under
pairwise aggregation of asset groups, provided admissibility is preserved.

The central question addressed in this paper is whether pricing-sufficient filtrations
associated with different asset groups admit a common admissible refinement.
Formally, given asset groups AA and BB with minimal pricing-sufficient filtrations
𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} and 𝔾B\mathbb{G}^{B}, one may ask whether there exists an admissible filtration
ℍ\mathbb{H} such that both SAS^{A} and SBS^{B} admit equivalent local martingale measures
relative to ℍ\mathbb{H}.
While such refinements exist in simple settings, the main results of the paper show that
they need not exist in general once multiple unspanned sources of uncertainty and
time-ordering constraints are present.

###### Remark 3.2 (Role of admissibility).

Admissibility restricts the class of trading strategies used to define no-arbitrage and
excludes anticipative or pathological strategies.
It does not alter the requirement that individual asset prices be local martingales under
a pricing measure.

### 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations

This section records local existence and stability properties of information structures
supporting martingale pricing for a fixed finite asset group.
The statements are formulated to separate clearly what follows from martingale theory
alone from what requires additional global assumptions.

We work relative to a reference filtered probability space
(Ω,ℱ,𝔽=(ℱt)t≥0,ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{F}=(\mathcal{F}\_{t})\_{t\geq 0},\mathbb{P})
satisfying the usual conditions.
All asset price processes are assumed to be
𝔽\mathbb{F}-semimartingales.
An *admissible filtration* will mean a right-continuous and complete subfiltration
ℍ=(ℋt)t≥0\mathbb{H}=(\mathcal{H}\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} of 𝔽\mathbb{F} such that the relevant asset prices are
ℍ\mathbb{H}-adapted and remain
ℍ\mathbb{H}-semimartingales.
This restriction rules out pathologies under filtration changes and is standard in the
enlargement-of-filtrations literature
[jeulin1980semi, jeulin1985grossissements]. Let AA be a finite index set and let SA=(Si)i∈AS^{A}=(S^{i})\_{i\in A} denote the corresponding vector
of discounted asset prices, viewed as an 𝔽\mathbb{F}-semimartingale.
Throughout this section, martingale properties of SAS^{A} are always understood
componentwise, that is, at the level of individual asset prices.
For any filtration ℍ\mathbb{H}, denote by 𝔽SA,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}} the usual
augmentation of the natural filtration generated by SAS^{A} within ℍ\mathbb{H}, that is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℱtSA,ℍ:=⋂u>tσ(SsA:0≤s≤u)∨𝒩ℍ,\mathcal{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}}\_{t}:=\bigcap\_{u>t}\sigma(S^{A}\_{s}:0\leq s\leq u)\,\vee\,\mathcal{N}^{\mathbb{H}}, |  |

where 𝒩ℍ\mathcal{N}^{\mathbb{H}} denotes the ℙ\mathbb{P}-null sets of
ℋ∞\mathcal{H}\_{\infty}.
Then 𝔽SA,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}} is right-continuous, complete, and satisfies
𝔽SA,ℍ⊆ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}}\subseteq\mathbb{H}.

###### Proposition 3.3 (Canonical local reduction of information).

Let ℍ\mathbb{H} be an admissible filtration and let ℚ∼ℙ\mathbb{Q}\sim\mathbb{P} be such that
SAS^{A} is a local (ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingale.
Then SAS^{A} is a local (ℚ,𝔽SA,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}})-martingale.

###### Proof 3.4.

Since SAS^{A} is 𝔽SA,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}}-adapted by construction and
𝔽SA,ℍ⊆ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}}\subseteq\mathbb{H}, any ℍ\mathbb{H}-localizing sequence for
SAS^{A} is also 𝔽SA,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}}-localizing.
Moreover, for each bounded 𝔽SA,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}}-stopping time τ\tau, τ\tau is also
an ℍ\mathbb{H}-stopping time, and the optional sampling theorem for local martingales
yields

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼ℚ​[Sτ∧TA∣ℱsSA,ℍ]=Ss∧τ∧TA,s≤T,\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}\!\left[S^{A}\_{\tau\wedge T}\mid\mathcal{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}}\_{s}\right]=S^{A}\_{s\wedge\tau\wedge T},\qquad s\leq T, |  |

after localization.
Hence SAS^{A} is a local martingale under ℚ\mathbb{Q} with respect to
𝔽SA,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}}.

Proposition [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem3 "Proposition 3.3 (Canonical local reduction of information). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") shows that whenever martingale pricing holds for
an asset group under some admissible information structure, it holds already under the
canonical reduced filtration generated by the asset prices themselves.
No aggregation or portfolio construction is involved in this reduction.

###### Definition 3.5 (Locally pricing-feasible filtration).

An admissible filtration ℍ\mathbb{H} is *locally pricing-feasible* for SAS^{A} if there
exists ℚ∼ℙ\mathbb{Q}\sim\mathbb{P} such that SAS^{A} is a local
(ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingale.
In this case, the filtration 𝔽SA,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}} will be called the associated
canonical pricing-sufficient filtration for the pair (ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H}).

The following stability properties are immediate from the construction.

###### Proposition 3.6 (Stability under restriction).

Let B⊂AB\subset A.
For any admissible filtration ℍ\mathbb{H},
𝔽SB,ℍ⊆𝔽SA,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{B},\mathbb{H}}\subseteq\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}} up to null sets.
Consequently, if SAS^{A} is a local (ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingale for some
ℚ∼ℙ\mathbb{Q}\sim\mathbb{P}, then SBS^{B} is a local
(ℚ,𝔽SA,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{F}^{S^{A},\mathbb{H}})-martingale.

###### Proof 3.7.

Since SBS^{B} is a coordinate projection of SAS^{A}, the σ\sigma-field generated by
{SsB:0≤s≤u}\{S^{B}\_{s}:0\leq s\leq u\} is contained in the σ\sigma-field generated by
{SsA:0≤s≤u}\{S^{A}\_{s}:0\leq s\leq u\} for each uu, and the inclusion is preserved under usual
augmentation.
The martingale claim follows from
Proposition [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem3 "Proposition 3.3 (Canonical local reduction of information). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

###### Proposition 3.8 (Pairwise compatibility under a common pricing measure).

Let AA and BB be asset groups and let ℍ\mathbb{H} be an admissible filtration.
Suppose there exists ℚ∼ℙ\mathbb{Q}\sim\mathbb{P} such that both SAS^{A} and SBS^{B} are local
(ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingales.
Then the concatenated process SA∪BS^{A\cup B} is a local
(ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingale, and hence a local
(ℚ,𝔽SA∪B,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{F}^{S^{A\cup B},\mathbb{H}})-martingale.

###### Proof 3.9.

If each coordinate of SA∪BS^{A\cup B} is a local (ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingale, then
SA∪BS^{A\cup B} is a vector local martingale.
The reduction to 𝔽SA∪B,ℍ\mathbb{F}^{S^{A\cup B},\mathbb{H}} follows from
Proposition [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem3 "Proposition 3.3 (Canonical local reduction of information). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

nature of martingale pricing under admissibility.
They isolate a canonical minimal information structure generated by the priced asset group
within any admissible filtration for which martingale pricing holds.
The global problem addressed in the remainder of the paper is not the existence of such
local reductions, but the compatibility of pricing across multiple asset groups when
admissibility and time-ordering constraints prevent the existence of a single filtration
and a single equivalent measure supporting all asset prices simultaneously.

### 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility

This section introduces the structural assumptions required for the global compatibility
problem studied in Section [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS4 "3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
The assumptions are stated in purely probabilistic terms and are independent of any
equilibrium, preference, or economic interpretation.
We continue to work on a reference filtered probability space
(Ω,ℱ,𝔽=(ℱt)t≥0,ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{F}=(\mathcal{F}\_{t})\_{t\geq 0},\mathbb{P})
satisfying the usual conditions.
All asset price processes are assumed to be 𝔽\mathbb{F}-semimartingales, and trading
strategies are required to be admissible in the sense of
Section [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Information Structures, Admissibility, and Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

We consider an auxiliary 𝔽\mathbb{F}-adapted process Y=(Yt)t≥0Y=(Y\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} taking values in
ℝk\mathbb{R}^{k}, interpreted as a collection of economic state variables.
The process YY is assumed to be of finite variation on compact time intervals.
No assumption is made that YY is traded or replicable by admissible strategies.

###### Definition 3.10 (Unspanned finite-variation drivers).

The process YY is said to be *unspanned* relative to a given asset group SAS^{A} if, for
every admissible trading strategy θ\theta with respect to SAS^{A}, the stochastic integral
∫0⋅θs​𝑑SsA\int\_{0}^{\cdot}\theta\_{s}\,dS^{A}\_{s} is orthogonal to YY in the sense that their quadratic
covariation vanishes identically.
This condition concerns hedging possibilities and does not alter the requirement that
martingale pricing applies componentwise to individual asset prices.

Unspannedness formalizes the requirement that fluctuations in YY cannot be hedged or
neutralized through admissible trading in SAS^{A}.
This condition is standard in the theory of incomplete markets. Time-scale separation is imposed through a conditional predictability restriction.

###### Definition 3.11 (Time-scale separation).

The driver process YY is said to be *slow relative to* SAS^{A} if, for every equivalent
local martingale measure ℚ\mathbb{Q} under which SAS^{A} is a local martingale with respect
to some admissible filtration, the Doob–Meyer decomposition of SAS^{A} relative to the
enlarged filtration 𝔽∨σ​(Y)\mathbb{F}\vee\sigma(Y) contains a predictable finite-variation
component that is measurable with respect to σ​(Y)\sigma(Y).

The terminology ”slow” is used in an informational sense: it refers to drivers whose
realizations become predictable relative to asset prices under filtration enlargement,
rather than to an explicit asymptotic separation of physical time scales.

###### Remark 3.12 (Status of the time-scale separation assumption).

Definition [3.11](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem11 "Definition 3.11 (Time-scale separation). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") is an explicit structural assumption rather than a property
derived from admissibility or no-arbitrage alone.
Its role is to formalize environments in which enlargement of the filtration by slow,
unspanned state variables induces predictable finite-variation components in individual
asset prices that cannot be neutralized by admissible trading strategies.
The results of Sections [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS4 "3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") and [3.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS5 "3.5 Dynamic Completeness and Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") are conditional on this
assumption and do not claim that time-scale separation holds universally.

This condition captures the idea that conditioning on YY introduces predictable drift
components into asset prices that are not present under smaller filtrations.
The interaction between admissibility and time-scale separation is summarized in the
following lemma.

###### Lemma 3.13 (Admissibility and non-anticipativity).

Let SAS^{A} be a discounted asset price process that is a local martingale under
(ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H}) for some admissible filtration ℍ\mathbb{H}.
Suppose YY is an unspanned finite-variation process that is slow relative to SAS^{A}.
Then there exists no admissible trading strategy θ\theta such that the predictable
finite-variation component induced by conditioning on σ​(Y)\sigma(Y) can be eliminated by
trading in SAS^{A}.

###### Proof 3.14.

Under enlargement of the filtration by σ​(Y)\sigma(Y), the process SAS^{A} admits a
Doob–Meyer decomposition of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | StA=Mt+At,S^{A}\_{t}=M\_{t}+A\_{t}, |  |

where MM is a local martingale and AA is a predictable finite-variation process
measurable with respect to σ​(Y)\sigma(Y).
By unspannedness, AA is orthogonal to all stochastic integrals generated by admissible
strategies.
Any attempt to neutralize AA through trading would require a strategy that anticipates
the evolution of YY, violating admissibility.
Hence no admissible strategy can eliminate the drift component.

Lemma [3.13](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem13 "Lemma 3.13 (Admissibility and non-anticipativity). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") isolates the precise mathematical mechanism by which
conditioning on slow, unspanned drivers conflicts with admissibility.
Enlarging the information structure introduces predictable components in individual asset
prices that cannot be offset by admissible trading strategies.

###### Corollary 3.15 (Obstruction to admissible refinement).

Under the assumptions of Lemma
  
 [3.13](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem13 "Lemma 3.13 (Admissibility and non-anticipativity). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), any admissible filtration relative
to which SAS^{A} is a local martingale cannot contain σ​(Y)\sigma(Y).

###### Proof 3.16.

If an admissible filtration ℍ\mathbb{H} contained σ​(Y)\sigma(Y) and supported martingale
pricing of SAS^{A}, then SAS^{A} would admit a local martingale decomposition without a
predictable finite-variation component relative to ℍ\mathbb{H}.
This contradicts Lemma [3.13](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem13 "Lemma 3.13 (Admissibility and non-anticipativity). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

Corollary [3.15](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem15 "Corollary 3.15 (Obstruction to admissible refinement). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") shows that slow unspanned drivers impose a hard
constraint on admissible information structures.
While pricing-sufficient filtrations may exist locally for individual asset groups, they
cannot be freely refined to incorporate additional slow state variables without violating
admissibility.

These constraints are local in nature and do not yet imply global incompatibility.
The next section shows that when multiple independent unspanned drivers are present, the
local constraints interact to produce a genuine obstruction to the existence of a single
admissible filtration and a single equivalent martingale measure supporting all asset
prices simultaneously.

### 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing

This section presents the main non-existence result of the paper. It shows that, under the
structural constraints introduced in Sections [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") and [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS3 "3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), local and pairwise martingale
pricing need not extend to a global admissible information structure. The obstruction is
minimal and arises for the first time when three independent unspanned sources of
uncertainty are present.

We continue to work on the reference filtered probability space
(Ω,ℱ,𝔽,ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{F},\mathbb{P}) introduced earlier. All asset price processes
are assumed to be 𝔽\mathbb{F}-semimartingales, and admissibility is understood in the sense
of Section [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Information Structures, Admissibility, and Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"). Throughout this section, an *admissible pricing structure* refers to a
pair (ℍ,ℚ)(\mathbb{H},\mathbb{Q}) consisting of an admissible filtration ℍ\mathbb{H} and a
probability measure ℚ∼ℙ\mathbb{Q}\sim\mathbb{P} under which the relevant asset prices are
local martingales.

Let Y1,Y2,Y3Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3} be three 𝔽\mathbb{F}-adapted finite-variation processes taking values in
ℝ\mathbb{R} and satisfying the following conditions. First, each YiY^{i} is unspanned
relative to the admissible trading strategies generated by the asset prices considered
below, in the sense of Definition [3.10](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem10 "Definition 3.10 (Unspanned finite-variation drivers). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"). Second, the processes are
mutually orthogonal, meaning that their quadratic covariations satisfy
[Yi,Yj]≡0[Y^{i},Y^{j}]\equiv 0 for all i≠ji\neq j. Third, each YiY^{i} is slow relative to the associated
asset group in the sense of Definition [3.11](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem11 "Definition 3.11 (Time-scale separation). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

We consider three asset groups A1,A2,A3A\_{1},A\_{2},A\_{3}, each consisting of finitely many assets, with
the property that pricing of assets in AiA\_{i} requires conditioning on YiY^{i}, but not on
YjY^{j} for j≠ij\neq i. More precisely, for each i∈{1,2,3}i\in\{1,2,3\} there exists an admissible
pricing structure (ℍi,ℚi)(\mathbb{H}^{i},\mathbb{Q}^{i}) such that SAiS^{A\_{i}} is a local
(ℚi,ℍi)(\mathbb{Q}^{i},\mathbb{H}^{i})-martingale and σ​(Yi)⊆ℍi\sigma(Y^{i})\subseteq\mathbb{H}^{i}, while
σ​(Yj)⊈ℍi\sigma(Y^{j})\nsubseteq\mathbb{H}^{i} for j≠ij\neq i. The following lemma records the key local compatibility property.

###### Lemma 3.17 (Local and pairwise compatibility).

For each i∈{1,2,3}i\in\{1,2,3\}, there exists an admissible pricing structure supporting martingale
pricing of SAiS^{A\_{i}}. Moreover, for each pair i≠ji\neq j, there exists an admissible pricing
structure supporting martingale pricing of SAi∪AjS^{A\_{i}\cup A\_{j}}.

###### Proof 3.18.

Local existence follows by assumption. For pairwise compatibility, consider asset groups
AiA\_{i} and AjA\_{j}. By construction, conditioning on σ​(Yi,Yj)\sigma(Y^{i},Y^{j}) introduces predictable
finite-variation components only through YiY^{i} and YjY^{j}. Since YiY^{i} and YjY^{j} are
independent of the remaining driver and unspanned relative to the other asset group,
admissibility is preserved and a common admissible filtration containing
σ​(Yi,Yj)\sigma(Y^{i},Y^{j}) supports martingale pricing of SAi∪AjS^{A\_{i}\cup A\_{j}}.

Lemma [3.17](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem17 "Lemma 3.17 (Local and pairwise compatibility). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") shows that all local and pairwise pricing problems
can be resolved within admissible information structures. The obstruction arises only at
the global level.

###### Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing).

Under the assumptions above, there exists no admissible pricing structure
(ℍ,ℚ)(\mathbb{H},\mathbb{Q}) such that SA1∪A2∪A3S^{A\_{1}\cup A\_{2}\cup A\_{3}} is a local
(ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingale.

###### Proof 3.20.

Suppose, for contradiction, that such an admissible pricing structure exists. Then
ℍ\mathbb{H} must simultaneously contain σ​(Y1)\sigma(Y^{1}), σ​(Y2)\sigma(Y^{2}), and
σ​(Y3)\sigma(Y^{3}) in order to eliminate predictable drift components associated with each asset
group. By Corollary [3.15](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem15 "Corollary 3.15 (Obstruction to admissible refinement). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), admissibility forbids any filtration
supporting martingale pricing of SAiS^{A\_{i}} from containing σ​(Yj)\sigma(Y^{j}) for j≠ij\neq i.
Hence no admissible filtration can contain all three σ​(Yi)\sigma(Y^{i}) simultaneously. This
contradiction establishes the claim.

The obstruction in Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") is minimal. With a single
unspanned driver, global martingale pricing is possible by conditioning on that driver.
With two independent unspanned drivers, pairwise conditioning remains admissible and a
global pricing structure exists. The failure arises for the first time with three
independent unspanned drivers and reflects a genuine structural incompatibility between
local pricing-sufficient information structures.

Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") shows that failure of global martingale pricing
need not arise from lack of local consistency or pairwise compatibility. Instead, it is a
consequence of the interaction between admissibility, time-ordering, and multiple
unspanned sources of uncertainty. Section [3.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS5 "3.5 Dynamic Completeness and Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") shows that this obstruction is equivalent to
failure of admissible dynamic completeness.

### 3.5 Dynamic Completeness and Global Martingale Pricing

This section places the obstruction result of Section [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS4 "3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") within the
classical theory of dynamic completeness.
The main result shows that the non-existence of a global admissible martingale pricing
structure is equivalent to failure of admissible dynamic completeness.
This equivalence clarifies the precise scope of the impossibility result and situates it
within established asset-pricing theory.

We work under the standing assumptions of
Sections [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Information Structures, Admissibility, and Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose")–[3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS4 "3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
In particular, admissible trading strategies are bounded from below, filtrations are
required to satisfy the usual conditions, and asset prices are semimartingales relative to
a reference filtration.
Dynamic completeness is understood relative to both a filtration and admissibility.
It is invoked here solely to characterize existence of a global martingale pricing measure
for asset prices, and not to introduce portfolio-based pricing objects.
Given an admissible filtration ℍ\mathbb{H} and a probability measure
ℚ∼ℙ\mathbb{Q}\sim\mathbb{P}, the market is said to be *dynamically complete under
(ℍ,ℚ)(\mathbb{H},\mathbb{Q})* if every square-integrable ℍ\mathbb{H}-martingale admits a
representation as a stochastic integral with respect to the asset price process SS using
admissible strategies. The following theorem establishes the equivalence between global martingale pricing and
admissible dynamic completeness.

###### Theorem 3.21 (Equivalence with admissible dynamic completeness).

The following statements are equivalent:

1. 1.

   There exists an admissible pricing structure (ℍ,ℚ)(\mathbb{H},\mathbb{Q}) such that the
   entire asset price vector SS is a local (ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingale.
2. 2.

   There exists an admissible filtration ℍ\mathbb{H} and a probability measure
   ℚ∼ℙ\mathbb{Q}\sim\mathbb{P} under which the market is dynamically complete.

###### Proof 3.22.

Suppose (1) holds.
If SS is a local (ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H})-martingale and the market is dynamically complete
under (ℍ,ℚ)(\mathbb{H},\mathbb{Q}), then standard martingale representation results imply that
every ℍ\mathbb{H}-martingale can be expressed as a stochastic integral with respect to
SS.
Hence (2) holds.

Conversely, suppose (2) holds.
Dynamic completeness implies uniqueness of the equivalent local martingale measure under
ℍ\mathbb{H} and ensures that all asset prices admit martingale representations under
(ℚ,ℍ)(\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{H}).
Hence (1) holds.

Theorem [3.21](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem21 "Theorem 3.21 (Equivalence with admissible dynamic completeness). ‣ 3.5 Dynamic Completeness and Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") shows that the obstruction identified in
Section [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS4 "3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") is not a failure of martingale pricing in general, but a
manifestation of failure of admissible dynamic completeness.
When admissible trading strategies span all sources of uncertainty present in the
filtration, a global equivalent martingale measure exists and the obstruction disappears.
Conversely, when admissible dynamic completeness fails, no single admissible filtration can
support martingale pricing for all assets simultaneously.

This equivalence highlights a structural distinction between classical formulations and
the present setting.
In standard results, dynamic completeness is studied relative to a fixed filtration.
Here, the filtration itself is constrained by admissibility and time-ordering, and the
obstruction arises because no admissible filtration supports completeness once multiple
unspanned sources of uncertainty are present.

The results of this paper therefore identify a sharp boundary for global martingale pricing
within the classical framework.
They show that local and pairwise martingale pricing may be compatible with admissibility
even when global pricing is not, and that this failure is equivalent to the impossibility
of achieving admissible dynamic completeness.
No claims are made beyond this probabilistic boundary, and the results do not preclude
alternative modeling approaches outside the martingale pricing framework.

The analysis shows that no-arbitrage pricing imposes strong constraints on admissible causal
reasoning.
Causality compatible with pricing is inherently filtration-dependent and may fail to admit
a global representation under realistic institutional constraints.
The results clarify the limits of aggregation in asset pricing and provide a unified
interpretation of market segmentation, regime dependence, and the instability of pricing
relations in incomplete markets.

The purpose of the experiments is not empirical testing or statistical validation,
but to visualize, in a controlled setting, how admissibility and filtration choice affect
the predictable finite-variation component in the Doob–Meyer decomposition of asset returns.
All non-existence and uniqueness results in the paper are purely theoretical and do not rely
on the numerical evidence presented here.

We simulate a market with three traded assets and three slow unspanned drivers, following
the explicit construction of Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A4 "Appendix D Explicit Three-Driver Construction ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
For i=1,2,3i=1,2,3, the drivers evolve according to

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1) |  | d​Yi​(t)=ε​(−κ​Yi​(t))​d​t+ε​ν​d​Bi​(t),ε≪1,dY\_{i}(t)=\varepsilon(-\kappa Y\_{i}(t))\,dt+\sqrt{\varepsilon}\,\nu\,dB\_{i}(t),\qquad\varepsilon\ll 1, |  |

and discounted asset prices satisfy

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2) |  | d​log⁡Si​(t)=(μ0+β​Yi​(t))​d​t+σ​d​Wi​(t).d\log S\_{i}(t)=(\mu\_{0}+\beta Y\_{i}(t))\,dt+\sigma\,dW\_{i}(t). |  |

Each asset’s drift depends only on its own driver, so that the drivers are unspanned relative
to the traded asset prices in the sense of Definition [3.10](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem10 "Definition 3.10 (Unspanned finite-variation drivers). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
The system is simulated using an Euler–Maruyama discretization at daily frequency over
approximately ten years.
Returns are defined as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Ri,t+1=log⁡Si​(t+1)−log⁡Si​(t).R\_{i,t+1}=\log S\_{i}(t+1)-\log S\_{i}(t). |  |

For any filtration (𝒢t)(\mathcal{G}\_{t}), the discrete-time Doob–Meyer decomposition yields

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3) |  | Rt+1=(Rt+1−mt)+mt,mt:=𝔼​[Rt+1∣𝒢t],R\_{t+1}=(R\_{t+1}-m\_{t})+m\_{t},\qquad m\_{t}:=\mathbb{E}[R\_{t+1}\mid\mathcal{G}\_{t}], |  |

with predictable finite-variation component
At:=∑u<tmuA\_{t}:=\sum\_{u<t}m\_{u}.
In the simulations, mtm\_{t} is approximated using an expanding-window least-squares estimator,
fitted using only information permitted by the filtration under consideration.
This procedure provides a diagnostic proxy for the predictable component induced by the
information structure.

We consider five information structures.
First, a price-only filtration based on past returns.
Second, an admissible local filtration conditioning on the asset’s own lagged driver.
Third, an admissible pairwise filtration conditioning on two lagged drivers.
These cases correspond to the local and pairwise pricing-feasible structures characterized
in Propositions [3.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem6 "Proposition 3.6 (Stability under restriction). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") and [3.8](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem8 "Proposition 3.8 (Pairwise compatibility under a common pricing measure). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
Fourth, an inadmissible global filtration obtained by two-sided smoothing of all three
drivers, violating time-ordering.
Fifth, an inadmissible global filtration that explicitly includes future driver increments
Δ​Yt+1\Delta Y\_{t+1}, violating admissibility through anticipativity.
The last two cases are included to illustrate the mechanism underlying
Lemma [3.13](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem13 "Lemma 3.13 (Admissibility and non-anticipativity). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"),

representative asset.
Under admissible filtrations, AtA\_{t} remains small and evolves slowly.
In contrast, once the filtration is enlarged in an inadmissible way, a pronounced drift
emerges in AtA\_{t}, indicating the presence of systematic predictability incompatible with
admissible trading.

increments m^t\hat{m}\_{t}.
Admissible filtrations produce distributions tightly concentrated around zero, while
inadmissible filtrations exhibit substantially greater dispersion.

Consistent with Propositions [3.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem6 "Proposition 3.6 (Stability under restriction). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") and [3.8](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem8 "Proposition 3.8 (Pairwise compatibility under a common pricing measure). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"),
admissible local and pairwise filtrations generate only limited predictability.
Enlarging the filtration in inadmissible ways leads to a systematic increase in the
predictable finite-variation component, with explicit future-increment leakage producing
the largest effects.

Taken together, the numerical illustrations provide a concrete visualization of the
mechanism behind Lemma [3.13](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem13 "Lemma 3.13 (Admissibility and non-anticipativity). ‣ 3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"),

They show how admissibility and time-ordering constrain the predictable finite-variation
component and why inadmissible enlargements of the information structure obstruct the
existence of a global martingale pricing filtration, even when local and pairwise pricing
consistency is preserved.

## 5 Conclusions and Future Work

This paper studies no-arbitrage asset pricing when the information structure is treated as an
endogenous object constrained by admissibility and time-ordering, rather than as an exogenously
fixed primitive. For any finite group of traded assets, we show that whenever martingale pricing
is feasible under some admissible filtration, it is already feasible under a canonical reduced
filtration generated by the asset prices themselves. These pricing-sufficient filtrations are
minimal, unique up to null sets, and stable under restriction of the asset set and under pairwise
aggregation, as established in
Propositions [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem3 "Proposition 3.3 (Canonical local reduction of information). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"),
[3.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem6 "Proposition 3.6 (Stability under restriction). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), and [3.8](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem8 "Proposition 3.8 (Pairwise compatibility under a common pricing measure). ‣ 3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

The main theoretical contribution is the identification of a sharp structural obstruction to
global martingale pricing. Under admissibility and time-ordering constraints, and in the presence
of multiple independent unspanned finite-variation drivers, there exists no admissible filtration
and no equivalent probability measure under which all admissible asset prices are jointly local
martingales. The obstruction is minimal: global pricing remains feasible with a single unspanned
driver; pairwise compatibility can be maintained with two independent drivers; and failure arises
for the first time with three independent drivers. As shown in
Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") and
Theorem [3.21](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem21 "Theorem 3.21 (Equivalence with admissible dynamic completeness). ‣ 3.5 Dynamic Completeness and Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), this non-existence result is equivalent to the failure
of admissible dynamic completeness, placing the obstruction squarely within the classical
no-arbitrage framework.

These results clarify a limitation not addressed by standard incompleteness theory. Classical
formulations analyze incompleteness relative to a fixed filtration and attribute non-uniqueness of
equivalent martingale measures to lack of spanning. Here, the obstruction arises at a more
primitive level. Even when each finite asset group admits a well-defined equivalent local
martingale measure and pairwise pricing consistency holds, admissibility and non-anticipativity
may prevent the existence of any single filtration supporting joint martingale pricing.

The numerical illustrations are intended solely as constructive diagnostics consistent with the
theory. Using a controlled simulated environment and discrete-time Doob–Meyer decompositions,
they visualize how admissible information structures induce only negligible predictable
finite-variation components, while inadmissible enlargements of the filtration (violating
admissibility or time-ordering) generate systematic predictability. The simulations do not test
the theoretical results, but illustrate the mechanism underlying the obstruction in
Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

#### Limitations and scope

Several limitations should be emphasized. The paper does not claim that global martingale measures
fail to exist in general, nor that markets are inherently incomplete; the impossibility result is
conditional on admissibility and time-ordering constraints and disappears under admissible dynamic
completeness. The analysis is independent of equilibrium considerations, and any causal language
is strictly interpretative. Finally, the numerical illustrations are not intended as empirical
validation, but as concrete examples illustrating the structural mechanisms identified in the
theory.

Future research directions include incorporating additional market frictions, such as transaction
costs or funding constraints, and extending the analysis to infinite-dimensional settings,
including term-structure models or markets with a continuum of assets. More broadly, the results
highlight that information, admissibility, and pricing are inseparable in arbitrage-free markets:
notions of dependence compatible with pricing must respect admissible trading and time-ordering
constraints, and may fail to admit a global representation even when local consistency is
preserved.

## Appendix A Existence and Minimality of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations

This appendix provides the formal construction and proofs underlying the existence,
minimality, and uniqueness of pricing-sufficient filtrations introduced in
Sections [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Information Structures, Admissibility, and Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") and [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 Local Existence and Stability of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"). Let (Ω,ℱ,(ℱt)t∈[0,T],ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}\_{t})\_{t\in[0,T]},\mathbb{P}) be a filtered probability space
satisfying the usual conditions.
Let A={Si1,…,Sik}A=\{S^{i\_{1}},\dots,S^{i\_{k}}\} be a finite admissible asset group, with discounted price
processes modeled as càdlàg semimartingales relative to (ℱt)(\mathcal{F}\_{t}). For any subfiltration 𝔾⊆(ℱt)\mathbb{G}\subseteq(\mathcal{F}\_{t}), let 𝒬​(𝔾)\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}) denote
the set of probability measures Q∼ℙQ\sim\mathbb{P} under which all assets in AA are
𝔾\mathbb{G}-local martingales.

### A.1 Construction of the minimal pricing-sufficient filtration

Define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝒢tA:=⋂𝔾⊆(ℱt)𝒬​(𝔾)≠∅𝒢t,\mathcal{G}^{A}\_{t}:=\bigcap\_{\begin{subarray}{c}\mathbb{G}\subseteq(\mathcal{F}\_{t})\\ \mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G})\neq\varnothing\end{subarray}}\mathcal{G}\_{t}, |  |

where the intersection is taken up to ℙ\mathbb{P}-null sets.
Let 𝔾A=(𝒢tA)t∈[0,T]\mathbb{G}^{A}=(\mathcal{G}^{A}\_{t})\_{t\in[0,T]}.

###### Lemma A.1 (Pricing consistency).

𝒬​(𝔾A)≠∅\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}^{A})\neq\varnothing.

###### Proof A.2.

By assumption, the absence of arbitrage under admissible trading implies the existence of
at least one filtration 𝔾~\widetilde{\mathbb{G}} such that
𝒬​(𝔾~)≠∅\mathcal{Q}(\widetilde{\mathbb{G}})\neq\varnothing.
By construction, 𝔾A⊆𝔾~\mathbb{G}^{A}\subseteq\widetilde{\mathbb{G}}.
Since restriction of a filtration preserves the local martingale property, any
Q∈𝒬​(𝔾~)Q\in\mathcal{Q}(\widetilde{\mathbb{G}}) also belongs to 𝒬​(𝔾A)\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}^{A}).

### A.2 Sufficiency and minimality

###### Theorem A.3 (Minimal pricing sufficiency).

The filtration 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} is pricing-sufficient and minimal up to ℙ\mathbb{P}-null sets.

###### Proof A.4.

By Lemma [A.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A1.Thmtheorem1 "Lemma A.1 (Pricing consistency). ‣ A.1 Construction of the minimal pricing-sufficient filtration ‣ Appendix A Existence and Minimality of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} is pricing-consistent.
Let 𝔾~⊊𝔾A\widetilde{\mathbb{G}}\subsetneq\mathbb{G}^{A} be a strict subfiltration.
Then by construction of 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A}, there exists no equivalent martingale measure
relative to 𝔾~\widetilde{\mathbb{G}}, implying
𝒬​(𝔾~)=∅\mathcal{Q}(\widetilde{\mathbb{G}})=\varnothing.
Hence 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} is minimal. Pricing sufficiency follows because 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} supports all equivalent martingale
measures compatible with admissible trading.

### A.3 Uniqueness

###### Theorem A.5 (Uniqueness).

Any two minimal pricing-sufficient filtrations for AA coincide up to ℙ\mathbb{P}-null sets.

###### Proof A.6.

Suppose 𝔾1\mathbb{G}^{1} and 𝔾2\mathbb{G}^{2} are both minimal pricing-sufficient filtrations.
Then 𝔾1⊆𝔾2\mathbb{G}^{1}\subseteq\mathbb{G}^{2} and 𝔾2⊆𝔾1\mathbb{G}^{2}\subseteq\mathbb{G}^{1} up to null sets,
otherwise one would contradict minimality.

### A.4 Relation to statistical sufficiency

The construction of 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} coincides with the minimal sufficient σ\sigma-field for the
family of probability measures 𝒬​(𝔾A)\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}^{A}) in the sense of classical
statistical decision theory [lehmann1998theory, kallenberg2002foundations].
In this sense, 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} captures precisely the information required for pricing the
asset group AA under admissibility.

Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A1 "Appendix A Existence and Minimality of Pricing-Sufficient Filtrations ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") establishes that pricing-sufficient filtrations exist,
are minimal and unique, and are canonically determined by no-arbitrage and admissibility.
These filtrations form the local building blocks for the analysis of global pricing
compatibility in subsequent sections.

## Appendix B Conditional Orthogonality and Risk-Neutralization

This appendix establishes the equivalence between conditional orthogonality of asset returns
and the existence of a joint equivalent local martingale measure relative to a fixed
filtration.
All results are purely probabilistic and rely on standard martingale and covariance
arguments. Let (Ω,ℱ,(𝒢t)t∈[0,T],ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{G}\_{t})\_{t\in[0,T]},\mathbb{P}) be a filtered probability space
satisfying the usual conditions.
Consider discounted asset price processes (S1,…,Sn)(S^{1},\dots,S^{n}), each modeled as a continuous
semimartingale of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​Sti=μti​d​t+∑k=1dσti​k​d​Wtk,dS^{i}\_{t}=\mu^{i}\_{t}\,dt+\sum\_{k=1}^{d}\sigma^{ik}\_{t}\,dW^{k}\_{t}, |  |

where WW is a dd-dimensional (𝒢t)(\mathcal{G}\_{t})-Brownian motion and coefficients are
𝒢t\mathcal{G}\_{t}-predictable. Let 𝒬​(𝔾)\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}) denote the set of probability measures Q∼ℙQ\sim\mathbb{P} under
which all SiS^{i} are (𝒢t)(\mathcal{G}\_{t})-local martingales.

### B.1 Conditional orthogonality

###### Definition B.1 (Conditional orthogonality).

The asset returns (d​Sti)(dS^{i}\_{t}) are conditionally orthogonal relative to 𝔾\mathbb{G} if their
predictable quadratic covariation satisfies

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ⟨Si,Sj⟩t≡0for all ​i≠j.\langle S^{i},S^{j}\rangle\_{t}\equiv 0\quad\text{for all }i\neq j. |  |

Equivalently,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[d​Sti​d​Stj∣𝒢t]=0for ​i≠j.\mathbb{E}[dS^{i}\_{t}\,dS^{j}\_{t}\mid\mathcal{G}\_{t}]=0\quad\text{for }i\neq j. |  |

Conditional orthogonality expresses that all statistical dependence relevant for pricing is
absorbed into the filtration 𝔾\mathbb{G}.

### B.2 Risk-neutral pricing implies orthogonality

###### Lemma B.2 (Risk-neutralization implies orthogonality).

If there exists Q∈𝒬​(𝔾)Q\in\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}) under which all SiS^{i} are
(𝒢t)(\mathcal{G}\_{t})-local martingales, then asset returns are conditionally orthogonal relative
to 𝔾\mathbb{G}.

###### Proof B.3.

Under QQ, each SiS^{i} has zero drift.
The martingale representation theorem implies that cross-variation terms must vanish,
otherwise predictable drift terms would arise under change of measure.

### B.3 Orthogonality implies joint risk-neutralization

###### Lemma B.4 (Orthogonality implies joint risk-neutralization).

Suppose asset returns are conditionally orthogonal relative to 𝔾\mathbb{G} and satisfy
standard integrability conditions.
Then there exists Q∈𝒬​(𝔾)Q\in\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}) under which all SiS^{i} are
(𝒢t)(\mathcal{G}\_{t})-local martingales.

###### Proof B.5.

Conditional orthogonality allows diagonalization of the covariance structure.
A multidimensional Girsanov transform can then be applied componentwise to remove the
predictable drift terms without introducing cross-dependence.

### B.4 Equivalence

###### Theorem B.6 (Equivalence).

Conditional orthogonality of asset returns relative to 𝔾\mathbb{G} is equivalent to the
existence of a joint equivalent local martingale measure relative to 𝔾\mathbb{G}.

###### Proof B.7.

The result follows immediately from Lemmas [B.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A2.Thmtheorem2 "Lemma B.2 (Risk-neutralization implies orthogonality). ‣ B.2 Risk-neutral pricing implies orthogonality ‣ Appendix B Conditional Orthogonality and Risk-Neutralization ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose")
and [B.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A2.Thmtheorem4 "Lemma B.4 (Orthogonality implies joint risk-neutralization). ‣ B.3 Orthogonality implies joint risk-neutralization ‣ Appendix B Conditional Orthogonality and Risk-Neutralization ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

###### Remark B.8.

All statements in this appendix are conditional on the choice of filtration.
The appendix does not assert the existence of a filtration under which conditional
orthogonality holds for all admissible assets. The main text shows that such filtrations may fail to exist globally under admissibility.

## Appendix C Local and Pairwise Pricing Compatibility

This appendix provides the detailed constructions underlying parts (i) and (ii) of
Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
We show that for individual asset groups and for pairs of asset groups, admissible
pricing-sufficient filtrations and equivalent local martingale measures exist.

### C.1 Local pricing under a single unspanned driver

Let AA be an admissible asset group driven by an unspanned slow driver YY as defined in
Section [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS3 "3.3 Time-Scale Separation, Unspanned Drivers, and Admissibility ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
Assume discounted asset prices admit dynamics of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​Sti=μi​(t,Yt)​d​t+σi​(t,Yt)​d​Wti,dS^{i}\_{t}=\mu^{i}(t,Y\_{t})\,dt+\sigma^{i}(t,Y\_{t})\,dW^{i}\_{t}, |  |

where WiW^{i} are independent Brownian motions and coefficients are sufficiently regular.

###### Lemma C.1 (Local risk-neutralization).

Conditioning on YY yields a pricing-sufficient filtration 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} and an equivalent
local martingale measure QAQ^{A} under which all assets in AA are 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A}-local
martingales.

###### Proof C.2.

Let 𝔾A\mathbb{G}^{A} be the filtration generated by (S,Y)(S,Y).
Under standard integrability conditions, a Girsanov transform removes the drift terms
μi​(t,Yt)\mu^{i}(t,Y\_{t}) without affecting admissibility.
Since YY is unspanned, conditioning restores martingale pricing without introducing
arbitrage.

### C.2 Pairwise compatibility

Let A1A\_{1} and A2A\_{2} be two admissible asset groups driven by independent unspanned drivers
Y1Y^{1} and Y2Y^{2}, respectively.

###### Lemma C.3 (Pairwise joint pricing).

Joint conditioning on (Y1,Y2)(Y^{1},Y^{2}) yields a pricing-sufficient filtration
𝔾12\mathbb{G}^{12} and an equivalent local martingale measure Q12Q^{12} pricing
A1∪A2A\_{1}\cup A\_{2}.

###### Proof C.4.

Let 𝔾12\mathbb{G}^{12} be the filtration generated by (SA1,SA2,Y1,Y2)(S^{A\_{1}},S^{A\_{2}},Y^{1},Y^{2}).
Independence of Y1Y^{1} and Y2Y^{2} ensures that joint conditioning does not introduce
predictability.
A two-dimensional Girsanov transform removes the drift terms for both asset groups
simultaneously, yielding a joint equivalent local martingale measure.

admissibility.

###### Proof C.6.

In both cases, conditioning does not render future increments of the driving Brownian
motions or slow drivers predictable.
Hence admissible trading strategies remain non-anticipative, and admissibility is
preserved.

Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A3 "Appendix C Local and Pairwise Pricing Compatibility ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") establishes that pricing-sufficient filtrations exist locally
and pairwise under admissibility.
These results justify parts (i) and (ii) of Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") and set the stage
for the global incompatibility demonstrated in Appendix E.

## Appendix D Explicit Three-Driver Construction

This appendix constructs explicitly the stochastic environment underlying
Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
The construction shows that local and pairwise pricing-consistent filtrations exist, while
global compatibility requires joint conditioning on three independent unspanned drivers.

### D.1 Underlying probability space

Let (Ω,ℱ,(ℱt)t∈[0,T],ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}\_{t})\_{t\in[0,T]},\mathbb{P}) support:

* •

  three independent Brownian motions W1,W2,W3W^{1},W^{2},W^{3},
* •

  three independent slow-moving drivers Y1,Y2,Y3Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3},

with (W1,W2,W3)(W^{1},W^{2},W^{3}) independent of (Y1,Y2,Y3)(Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3}).
The drivers YiY^{i} are assumed to be continuous semimartingales evolving on a slower time
scale than the Brownian motions, e.g.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​Yti=ε​bi​(Yti)​d​t+ε​νi​(Yti)​d​Bti,0<ε≪1,dY^{i}\_{t}=\varepsilon\,b^{i}(Y^{i}\_{t})\,dt+\sqrt{\varepsilon}\,\nu^{i}(Y^{i}\_{t})\,dB^{i}\_{t},\quad 0<\varepsilon\ll 1, |  |

where BiB^{i} are independent Brownian motions.

### D.2 Asset dynamics

Define three asset groups A1,A2,A3A\_{1},A\_{2},A\_{3}, each consisting of a single discounted asset
SiS^{i} with dynamics

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​Sti=μi​(Yti)​d​t+σi​(Yti)​d​Wti,i=1,2,3.dS^{i}\_{t}=\mu^{i}(Y^{i}\_{t})\,dt+\sigma^{i}(Y^{i}\_{t})\,dW^{i}\_{t},\quad i=1,2,3. |  |

Each asset SiS^{i} depends only on its corresponding slow driver YiY^{i} and fast noise WiW^{i}.
The drivers are unspanned: no admissible trading strategy in SiS^{i} can replicate or hedge
YiY^{i}.

### D.3 Local pricing-sufficient filtrations

For each ii, define the filtration

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔾i:=σ​{Ssi,Ysi:s≤t}t∈[0,T].\mathbb{G}^{i}:=\sigma\{S^{i}\_{s},Y^{i}\_{s}:s\leq t\}\_{t\in[0,T]}. |  |

###### Lemma D.1 (Local pricing).

Relative to 𝔾i\mathbb{G}^{i}, there exists an equivalent local martingale measure QiQ^{i} under
which SiS^{i} is a 𝔾i\mathbb{G}^{i}-local martingale.

###### Proof D.2.

Conditioning on YiY^{i}, a one-dimensional Girsanov transform removes the drift
  
μi​(Yti)\mu^{i}(Y^{i}\_{t}). Since YiY^{i} is unspanned, admissibility is preserved.

### D.4 Pairwise joint filtrations

For each pair (i,j)(i,j) with i≠ji\neq j, define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔾i​j:=σ​{Ssi,Ssj,Ysi,Ysj:s≤t}t∈[0,T].\mathbb{G}^{ij}:=\sigma\{S^{i}\_{s},S^{j}\_{s},Y^{i}\_{s},Y^{j}\_{s}:s\leq t\}\_{t\in[0,T]}. |  |

###### Lemma D.3 (Pairwise pricing consistency).

Relative to 𝔾i​j\mathbb{G}^{ij}, there exists an equivalent local martingale measure Qi​jQ^{ij}
under which both SiS^{i} and SjS^{j} are 𝔾i​j\mathbb{G}^{ij}-local martingales.

###### Proof D.4.

Joint conditioning on (Yi,Yj)(Y^{i},Y^{j}) preserves non-anticipativity. A two-dimensional Girsanov transform removes both drift components simultaneously.

### D.5 Necessity of triple conditioning

Any filtration under which all three assets
  
S1,S2,S3S^{1},S^{2},S^{3} are local martingales must contain information about all three drivers (Y1,Y2,Y3)(Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3}).
Indeed, failure to condition on one driver leaves a non-zero predictable drift in the corresponding asset. Thus any candidate global pricing-consistent filtration must refine

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | σ​{S1,S2,S3,Y1,Y2,Y3}.\sigma\{S^{1},S^{2},S^{3},Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3}\}. |  |

Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A4 "Appendix D Explicit Three-Driver Construction ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") establishes that:

* •

  local pricing-consistent filtrations exist for each asset group,
* •

  pairwise pricing-consistent filtrations exist for any two asset groups,
* •

  any global pricing-consistent filtration must condition jointly on all three
  unspanned drivers.

Appendix E shows that such joint conditioning violates admissibility, completing the proof
of Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

## Appendix E Admissibility Violations and Non-Anticipativity

This appendix completes the proof of Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") by showing that any
filtration conditioning jointly on three independent unspanned slow drivers violates
admissibility.
The violation arises through predictability of future increments and is independent of
preferences or equilibrium considerations.

###### Remark E.1 (Scope of the triple-conditioning argument).

Appendix [E](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A5 "Appendix E Admissibility Violations and Non-Anticipativity ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") establishes
  
non-admissibility of joint conditioning on three independent unspanned slow drivers by means of an explicit stylized construction. The argument does not claim that any arbitrary triple of finite-variation processes induces predictability, but rather that there exist economically natural and probabilistically well-defined environments in which triple conditioning necessarily violates non-anticipativity under time-scale separation. The result is therefore constructive rather than universal.

### E.1 Non-anticipativity and admissibility

Recall that admissible trading strategies must be predictable with respect to the pricing
filtration.
A filtration is admissible only if future innovations of driving processes are not
predictable relative to that filtration. Formally, let XX be a semimartingale.
A filtration 𝔾\mathbb{G} is admissible for XX if the compensator of XX relative to
𝔾\mathbb{G} does not contain information about future increments of XX.

### E.2 Triple conditioning induces predictability

Consider the three-driver construction of Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A4 "Appendix D Explicit Three-Driver Construction ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").
Let 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast} be any filtration satisfying

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | σ​{Ss1,Ss2,Ss3,Ys1,Ys2,Ys3:s≤t}⊆𝒢t∗⊆ℱt.\sigma\{S^{1}\_{s},S^{2}\_{s},S^{3}\_{s},Y^{1}\_{s},Y^{2}\_{s},Y^{3}\_{s}:s\leq t\}\subseteq\mathcal{G}^{\ast}\_{t}\subseteq\mathcal{F}\_{t}. |  |

###### Lemma E.2 (Predictability under triple conditioning).

Relative to 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast}, at least one of the slow drivers Y1,Y2,Y3Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3} has predictable
future increments.

###### Proof E.3.

The slow drivers (Y1,Y2,Y3)(Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3}) evolve on a coarser time scale than the Brownian motions
(W1,W2,W3)(W^{1},W^{2},W^{3}) driving asset prices.
Joint conditioning on all three drivers overconstrains the filtration.
Specifically, the joint σ\sigma-field generated by (Y1,Y2,Y3)(Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3}) resolves sufficient
information about the slow components to render at least one driver’s future increments
measurable relative to 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast}.

Formally, time-scale separation implies that the predictable σ\sigma-field relative to
𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast} contains non-trivial information about the future evolution of at least one
YiY^{i}.
This violates the Doob–Meyer decomposition for YiY^{i} relative to 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast}, inducing a
predictable drift component.

###### Remark E.4 (Sufficient condition for induced predictability).

A sufficient condition for the conclusion of Lemma [E.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A5.Thmtheorem2 "Lemma E.2 (Predictability under triple conditioning). ‣ E.2 Triple conditioning induces predictability ‣ Appendix E Admissibility Violations and Non-Anticipativity ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") is failure of the immersion (H-hypothesis) of the filtration generated by the slow drivers into the reference filtration. Under time-scale separation, joint conditioning on three independent slow components overdetermines the predictable σ\sigma-field, implying that at least one driver admits a non-trivial predictable compensator. This mechanism is made explicit in the construction of Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A4 "Appendix D Explicit Three-Driver Construction ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

### E.3 Violation of admissibility

###### Proposition E.5 (Failure of admissibility).

No filtration 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast} conditioning jointly on
  
(Y1,Y2,Y3)(Y^{1},Y^{2},Y^{3}) is admissible.

###### Proof E.6.

By Lemma [E.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A5.Thmtheorem2 "Lemma E.2 (Predictability under triple conditioning). ‣ E.2 Triple conditioning induces predictability ‣ Appendix E Admissibility Violations and Non-Anticipativity ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), at least one slow driver acquires predictable future
increments relative to 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast}.
As asset prices depend on these drivers, trading strategies can exploit this predictability
to generate unbounded gains, violating admissibility.
Therefore 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast} cannot support admissible trading.

### E.4 Non-existence of a global martingale measure

###### Theorem E.7 (No global equivalent martingale measure).

There exists no admissible filtration 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast} and no probability measure
Q∗∼ℙQ^{\ast}\sim\mathbb{P} under which all three assets (S1,S2,S3)(S^{1},S^{2},S^{3}) are local martingales.

###### Proof E.8.

Any filtration supporting joint martingale pricing must condition on all three drivers.
By Proposition [E.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A5.Thmtheorem5 "Proposition E.5 (Failure of admissibility). ‣ E.3 Violation of admissibility ‣ Appendix E Admissibility Violations and Non-Anticipativity ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), such filtrations are inadmissible.
Hence no global equivalent martingale measure exists under admissibility.

Appendix [E](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A5 "Appendix E Admissibility Violations and Non-Anticipativity ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") shows that the obstruction identified in
Theorem [3.19](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.Thmtheorem19 "Theorem 3.19 (Minimal obstruction to global martingale pricing). ‣ 3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") arises from non-anticipativity constraints.
The failure of global pricing consistency is structural and cannot be resolved by refining
probability spaces or enlarging filtrations without violating admissibility.

## Appendix F Equivalence with Admissible Dynamic Completeness

This appendix establishes the equivalence between the existence of a global pricing-consistent filtration and admissible dynamic completeness.
The result clarifies that the obstruction identified in Section [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS4 "3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose")
is not a general impossibility, but a sharp boundary determined by market completeness.

### F.1 Dynamic completeness

Recall that a market is dynamically complete if every contingent claim measurable with
respect to the relevant filtration can be replicated by admissible trading strategies.
We emphasize admissibility throughout.

###### Definition F.1 (Admissible dynamic completeness).

The market is admissibly dynamically complete if for every square-integrable
(ℱT)(\mathcal{F}\_{T})-measurable random variable XX, there exists an admissible self-financing
strategy θ\theta such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | X=X0+(θ⋅S)T.X=X\_{0}+(\theta\cdot S)\_{T}. |  |

### F.2 Dynamic completeness implies global pricing consistency

###### Theorem F.2 (Completeness implies global ELMM).

If the market is admissibly dynamically complete, then there exists an admissible filtration
𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast} and a probability measure Q∗∼ℙQ^{\ast}\sim\mathbb{P} such that all admissible
asset prices are 𝔾∗\mathbb{G}^{\ast}-local martingales under Q∗Q^{\ast}.

###### Proof F.3.

Under admissible dynamic completeness, the martingale representation property holds
relative to the admissible filtration generated by traded assets.
Standard arguments (see [karatzas1998brownian]) imply existence of a unique
equivalent martingale measure.
Admissibility ensures that the filtration does not permit anticipative strategies.

### F.3 Failure of global pricing consistency implies incompleteness

###### Theorem F.4 (Global inconsistency implies incompleteness).

If no admissible filtration supports a global equivalent martingale measure, then the
market is not admissibly dynamically complete.

###### Proof F.5.

Suppose admissible dynamic completeness holds.
By Theorem [F.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A6.Thmtheorem2 "Theorem F.2 (Completeness implies global ELMM). ‣ F.2 Dynamic completeness implies global pricing consistency ‣ Appendix F Equivalence with Admissible Dynamic Completeness ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose"), a global pricing-consistent filtration and
equivalent martingale measure must exist, contradicting the assumption.

### F.4 Equivalence

###### Theorem F.6 (Equivalence).

A global pricing-consistent filtration exists if and only if the market is admissibly
dynamically complete.

###### Proof F.7.

The result follows directly from Theorems [F.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A6.Thmtheorem2 "Theorem F.2 (Completeness implies global ELMM). ‣ F.2 Dynamic completeness implies global pricing consistency ‣ Appendix F Equivalence with Admissible Dynamic Completeness ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") and
[F.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A6.Thmtheorem4 "Theorem F.4 (Global inconsistency implies incompleteness). ‣ F.3 Failure of global pricing consistency implies incompleteness ‣ Appendix F Equivalence with Admissible Dynamic Completeness ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

### F.5 Relation to the three-driver obstruction

The three-driver construction of Section [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#S3.SS4 "3.4 A Minimal Obstruction to Global Martingale Pricing ‣ 3 Main Results ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") provides an explicit example
in which admissible dynamic completeness fails.
Unspanned slow drivers introduce sources of uncertainty that cannot be replicated by
admissible trading strategies.
As a result, no global pricing-consistent filtration exists. Conversely, in classical complete-market models (such as Black–Scholes or complete
Arrow–Debreu economies) the obstruction disappears, consistent with
Theorem [F.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A6.Thmtheorem6 "Theorem F.6 (Equivalence). ‣ F.4 Equivalence ‣ Appendix F Equivalence with Admissible Dynamic Completeness ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose").

Appendix [F](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.12541v1#A6 "Appendix F Equivalence with Admissible Dynamic Completeness ‣ Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale PricingSubmitted to the editors 17/01/2026. \fundingThere is no funding to disclose") shows that the main impossibility result of the paper is
equivalent to the failure of admissible dynamic completeness.
This places the analysis firmly within the classical asset-pricing framework and clarifies
the precise boundary of applicability of the obstruction.

## Appendix G Pricing-Consistent Causality and Causal Frameworks

This appendix compares the notion of pricing-consistent causality implicit in the main text
with standard notions of causality used in statistics and econometrics.
The purpose is not to propose an alternative causal framework, but to clarify which forms
of causal reasoning are compatible with no-arbitrage pricing under admissibility.

### G.1 Pricing-consistent causality

Throughout the paper, causality is not postulated as a primitive concept.
Instead, it is derived from invariance properties of valuation operators under admissible
changes to information structures.

Formally, let 𝔾\mathbb{G} be a minimal pricing-sufficient filtration for an asset group AA,
and let 𝒬​(𝔾)\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}) denote the corresponding set of equivalent local martingale
measures. A transformation of an economic variable is said to be *pricing-consistent* if it
induces invariant pricing kernels across all measures in 𝒬​(𝔾)\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{G}). Only such transformations admit causal interpretation within the pricing framework.
All statements are conditional on the filtration and admissibility constraints.

### G.2 Pearl-style structural causal models

Structural causal models as developed by Pearl [pearl2009causality] define
causality through counterfactual interventions implemented via the do​(⋅)\texttt{do}(\cdot)
operator.
An intervention replaces a structural equation while holding others fixed.

In financial markets, such interventions are generally incompatible with pricing.
Replacing the law of a price process, volatility, or funding variable while holding trading
opportunities fixed typically violates self-financing or admissibility constraints.
As a result, the martingale property is destroyed and no equivalent martingale measure
exists under the intervened system. Thus, Pearl-style interventions are not admissible operations in the sense of
no-arbitrage pricing.
The incompatibility is structural and does not depend on equilibrium assumptions.

### G.3 Granger causality

Granger causality [granger1969investigating] defines causality through predictability:
a process XX Granger-causes YY if past values of XX improve prediction of YY relative to a given filtration. This notion is purely predictive and filtration-dependent. It is compatible with pricing-consistent causality but strictly weaker.
Predictive relationships may exist that have no pricing relevance, and conversely,
pricing-relevant variables may fail to Granger-cause prices if their effects are absorbed into the pricing kernel. Granger causality therefore captures temporal dependence, not structural invariance under admissible changes.

### G.4 Structural equation models in econometrics

Econometric structural models often specify systems of stochastic equations with
exogenous shocks and identify causal effects through exclusion restrictions or instruments [imbens2015causal].

Such models typically assume a fixed probability space and allow counterfactual variation of structural parameters. In contrast, asset pricing constrains probability measures through no-arbitrage and admissibility.
Structural variations that violate these constraints are not meaningful within the pricing framework. Accordingly, pricing-consistent causality is more restrictive than standard structural causality but applies in settings where prices and information are endogenously linked. The distinctions can be summarized as follows:

* •

  Pearl SCMs allow arbitrary counterfactual interventions; pricing-consistent causality
  allows only admissible transformations preserving martingale pricing.
* •

  Granger causality captures predictability, not invariance.
* •

  Structural econometric models fix probability spaces ex ante; pricing endogenizes the
  probability measure through no-arbitrage.

As a result, causal reasoning compatible with asset pricing is necessarily local,
filtration-dependent, and constrained by admissibility.
This limitation is not a deficiency of causal modeling, but a structural feature of
no-arbitrage markets.
