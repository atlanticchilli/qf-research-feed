###### Abstract

This study introduces a new analytical framework for quantifying multivariate risk measures. Using the Wishart process, which is a stochastic process with values in the space of positive definite matrices, we derive several conditional tail risk measures which, thanks to the remarkable analytical properties of the Wishart process, can be explicitly computed up to a one- or two-dimensional integration. These quantities can also be used to solve analytically a capital allocation problem based on conditional moments. Exploiting the stochastic differential equation property of the Wishart process, we show how an intertemporal (i.e., time-lagged) view of these risk measures can be embedded in the proposed framework. Several numerical examples show that the framework is versatile and operational, thus providing a useful tool for risk management.

## 1 Introduction

The modeling of risk measures is crucial for various applications such as risk management and reserving. The literature in this field is extensive and diverse. For example, Landsman and Valdez ([2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib33 "Tail conditional expectations for exponential dispersion models")) derive the tail conditional expectation for the exponential dispersion family, Furman and Landsman ([2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib41 "Risk capital decomposition for a multivariate dependent gamma portfolio")) examine the tail conditional expectation for a multivariate gamma portfolio with dependent risks, providing explicit formulas for tail conditional expectations and risk capital allocations. Xu and Mao ([2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib29 "Optimal capital allocation based on the tail mean–variance model")) solve a capital allocation problem based on a tail mean-variance model that requires the conditional higher moments up to order three of the underlying variables. They illustrate their model using a multivariate elliptical distribution. More recently, Ignatieva and Landsman ([2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib26 "Estimating the tails of loss severity via conditional risk measures for the family of symmetric generalised hyperbolic distributions")), Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")), and Ignatieva and Landsman ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib43 "A class of generalised hyper-elliptical distributions and their applications in computing conditional tail risk measures")) compute a closed-form expression for the tail conditional expectation for generalized hyperbolic/hyper-elliptical distributions,  while Ignatieva and Landsman ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib44 "Tail variance for generalised hyper-elliptical models")) extend these computations to the second order, that is, the tail variance. Cheung et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib30 "Multivariate matrix-exponential affine mixtures and their applications in risk theory")) compute a wide variety of risk measures for multivariate matrix-exponential affine mixture models.

In this work, we extend the perspective developed in Dufresne et al. ([2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib17 "Fourier inversion formulas in option pricing and insurance")), which computes the Tail Conditional Expectation (TCE) for a univariate loss, to a framework that enables the computation of the TCE for risks, whether individual risks or aggregates, of any moment, across a wide range of random variable distributions, provided their moment generating function (MGF) is available.222Whenever the MGF is not available, as in the case of the Pareto distribution, for example, the characteristic function can be used instead; see Dufresne et al. ([2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib17 "Fourier inversion formulas in option pricing and insurance")) for the scalar case.

Additionally, our framework incorporates general dependence among risks, or losses across individual lines, by considering distributions on the space of symmetric positive definite matrices, for which the joint MGF is known for many distributions. This approach does not rely on a specific distribution to derive the TCE or any higher order tail conditional moments. If the static distribution used to compute risk measures can be embedded into a (time-dependent) stochastic process, it becomes possible to compute intertemporal or time-lagged TCEs (or any higher order tail conditional moments). The intertemporal/time-lagged TCE represents the expected loss at time t1t\_{1}, given that the loss at time t0t\_{0} exceeded a certain threshold x∗x\_{\*}, where t0<t1t\_{0}<t\_{1}. We can also compute the TCE at two different time points for dependent losses, provided the joint MGF is known at both t0t\_{0} and t1t\_{1} for the individual lines. This property extends the static or time-independent perspective analyzed in the aforementioned literature to the dynamic or time-series point of view considered in more recent studies (e.g., Chavez-Demoulin and Guillou ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib3 "Extreme quantile estimation for β-mixing time series and applications")), Patton et al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib20 "Dynamic semiparametric models for expected shortfall (and value-at-risk)")), Goegebeur and Guillou ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib5 "A conditional tail expectation type risk measure for time series")), Goegebeur et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib6 "Marginal expected shortfall risk measure for time series")), or Liu et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib1 "Time-lagged marginal expected shortfall"))).333The dynamic property can also be understood in the sense of Riedel ([2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib39 "Dynamic coherent risk measures")), Artzner et al. ([2007](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib40 "Coherent multiperiod risk adjusted values and Bellman’s principle")), Hardy and Wirch ([2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib8 "The Iterated Cte")), or Devolder and Lebègue ([2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib7 "Iterated VaR or CTE measures: A false good idea?")), which differs from the purely time-series point of view adopted here. Compared to this literature, our modeling strategy based on the Wishart process provides control over both the evolution of losses and their dependencies.

In modeling portfolio losses, it is important to recognize that losses can exhibit dependence across different losses. Traditional copula-based methods often impose constraints on the types of dependencies we can effectively model, limiting their flexibility.  The literature on risk measures using copulas to handle dependence is extensive. Without pretending to be exhaustive, let us mention Cousin and Di Bernardino ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib15 "On multivariate extensions of conditional-tail-expectation")) and Di Bernardino et al. ([2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib16 "On multivariate extensions of the conditional Value-at-Risk measure")).  An alternative to the copula approach is the factor model approach of Furman and Landsman ([2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib41 "Risk capital decomposition for a multivariate dependent gamma portfolio")), which is based on a vector of independent positive variables. In this framework, all losses are expressed as linear functions of this vector and share a common component, akin to a principal component analysis. This modeling strategy imposes certain constraints on the sign of the dependencies. The alternative that we propose is to capture these relationships by directly specifying both the losses and their dependence structure simultaneously. A natural framework for this purpose is to view losses within the space of positive definite matrices, similar to how covariances are treated in portfolio theory. This approach not only aligns with the inherent structure of dependence but also allows for richer modeling of the interactions between different losses.

The Wishart process, originally defined by Bru ([1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib85 "Wishart processes")), is a flexible process applied in option pricing, mortality modeling, and equity modeling. It is a positive definite matrix process, making it suitable for modeling positive events such as losses and their dependencies.  As such, it can be seen as an extension of Furman and Landsman ([2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib41 "Risk capital decomposition for a multivariate dependent gamma portfolio")) where the dependence between the losses is directly modeled. As an affine process, its MGF is known in closed form. Furthermore, the derivative of the MGF can be computed explicitly, a property that plays a crucial role in operationalising the implementation of risk measures. One of the key ingredients of our approach is to express different risk measures in terms of the MGF of the losses, thereby enabling us to fully exploit this property of the Wishart process. Note that many of our results hold for any distribution, as long as its MGF is known. We highlight our framework using the Wishart process, demonstrating that it satisfies the integrability conditions required by our framework and providing a numerical implementation to showcase the speed and accuracy of our results.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2 "2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks.

In Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3 "3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

The usual caveat applies."), we present our main result: the ability to compute multivariate risk measures using their Fourier transforms. By utilizing the Fourier transform, we express conditional tail expectations in terms of the joint MGF of random variables and derive these expressions even when a temporal element is introduced. We then prove that the Wishart process meets the integrability conditions for applying these results. We show that our approach is comparable to existing frameworks in terms of numerical cost.

## 2 The mathematical framework

Given a filtered probability space (Ω,ℱ,ℱt,ℙ)(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{F}\_{t},\mathbb{P}), we denote by 𝔼​[⋅]\mathbb{E}\left[\,\cdot\,\right] the expectation under the probability measure ℙ\mathbb{P}, and by 𝔼t[⋅]:=𝔼[⋅|ℱt]\mathbb{E}\_{t}\left[\,\cdot\,\right]:=\mathbb{E}\left[\,\cdot\,|\mathcal{F}\_{t}\right] the conditional expectation under ℙ\mathbb{P}. The Wishart process, proposed in Bru ([1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib85 "Wishart processes")), satisfies the matrix stochastic differential equation

|  | d​xt=(ω+m​xt+xt​m⊤)​d​t+xt​d​wt​σ+σ⊤​d​wt⊤​xt,dx\_{t}=(\omega+mx\_{t}+x\_{t}m^{\top})dt+\sqrt{x\_{t}}dw\_{t}\sigma+\sigma^{\top}dw\_{t}^{\top}\sqrt{x\_{t}}\,, |  | (1) |

where xtx\_{t} is an n×nn\times n matrix that belongs to the set of positive definite matrices denoted 𝕊n++\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++} (𝕊n+\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{+} stands for the set of positive semi-definite matrices, 𝕊n\mathbb{S}\_{n} the set of real n×nn\times n symmetric matrices). The matrix mm belongs to the set of n×nn\times n real matrices denoted 𝖬​(n)\mathsf{M}(n) and is such that {ℜ⁡(λim)<0;i=1,…,n}\{\Re(\lambda\_{i}^{m})<0;i=1,\ldots,n\}, where λim∈S​p​e​c​(m)\lambda\_{i}^{m}\in Spec(m) for i=1,…,ni=1,\ldots,n and S​p​e​c​(m)Spec(m) is the spectrum of the matrix mm, while ℜ⁡(⋅)\Re(\,\cdot\,) stands for the real part. Lastly, {wt;t≥0}\{w\_{t};t\geq 0\} is a standard matrix Brownian motion of dimension n×nn\times n (i.e., a matrix of n2n^{2} independent scalar standard Brownian motions) under the probability measure ℙ\mathbb{P}, and ⋅⊤\cdot^{\top} stands for the matrix transposition. Thanks to the invariance of the law of the Brownian motion to rotations and the polar decomposition of σ\sigma, we can restrict to σ∈𝕊n++\sigma\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++} without loss of generality. The matrix ω∈𝕊n++\omega\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++} satisfies certain constraints, clarified below, involving σ2\sigma^{2} to ensure the positive definiteness of the matrix process xtx\_{t}. The quantity xt\sqrt{x\_{t}} is well-defined and unique since xt∈𝕊n++x\_{t}\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++}. We denote by ei​je\_{ij} the basis of 𝖬​(n)\mathsf{M}(n); it is the n×nn\times n matrix with 11 in the (i,j)(i,j) place and 0 elsewhere. The identity matrix of 𝖬​(n)\mathsf{M}(n) is denoted InI\_{n}. We also introduce the symbols tr​[⋅]\textup{tr}[\,\cdot\,] for the trace of a matrix, vec​(⋅)\textup{vec}\left(\cdot\right) for the operator which transforms an n×nn\times n matrix into an n2n^{2} vector by stacking the columns, ⊗\otimes for the Kronecker product, det(⋅)\det(\cdot) for the determinant of a matrix, and ∥⋅∥\|\cdot\| for the matrix norm associated with tr​[⋅]\textup{tr}[\,\cdot\,].

The Wishart process was initially defined and analyzed in Bru ([1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib85 "Wishart processes")) under the assumption that ω=β​σ2\omega=\beta\sigma^{2} with β∈ℝ+\beta\in\mathbb{R}\_{+} such that β≥n+1\beta\geq n+1 to ensure that for all t>0t>0 we have xt∈𝕊n++x\_{t}\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++}. Hereafter, this specification will be referred to as the Bru case. It was later extended in Mayerhofer et al. ([2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib89 "On strong solutions of positive definite jump-diffusions")) (see also Cuchiero et al. ([2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib88 "Affine processes on positive semidefinite matrices"))) to the case ω∈𝕊n++\omega\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++} and proved that if

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ω⪰β​σ2,\displaystyle\omega\succeq\beta\sigma^{2}\,, |  | (2) |

with β≥n+1\beta\geq n+1, where ([2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.E2 "In 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) means that ω−β​σ2∈𝕊n++\omega-\beta\sigma^{2}\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++}, then for all t>0t>0 we have xt∈𝕊n++x\_{t}\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++}.

The infinitesimal generator of the Wishart process is given by Bru ([1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib85 "Wishart processes")):

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝒢=tr​[(ω+m​x+x​m⊤)​D+2​x​D​σ2​D],\displaystyle\mathcal{G}=\textup{tr}[(\omega+mx+xm^{\top})D+2xD\sigma^{2}D]\,, |  | (3) |

where DD is the (n×n)(n\times n) matrix operator Di​j:=∂xi​jD\_{ij}:=\partial\_{x\_{ij}}.

Bru ([1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib85 "Wishart processes")) showed that as the Wishart process is affine, its MGF is exponentially affine. More precisely, the MGF of xtx\_{t} is given by the following proposition, see Grasselli and Tebaldi ([2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib86 "Solvable affine term structure models")) and Alfonsi ([2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib37 "Affine diffusions and related processes: simulation, theory and applications")) for details.

If we further assume that ω=β​σ2\omega=\beta\sigma^{2} with β∈ℝ\beta\in\mathbb{R} and β≥n+1\beta\geq n+1 then b​(t,θ0)b(t,\theta\_{0}) is given by

###### Corollary 2.2.

If we assume that ω=β​σ2\omega=\beta\sigma^{2} with β∈ℝ\beta\in\mathbb{R} and β≥n+1\beta\geq n+1, then the MGF of x∞=limt→+∞xtx\_{\infty}=\lim\_{t\to+\infty}x\_{t}, denoted Φ∞​(θ):=limt→+∞Φ​(t,θ,x0)=𝔼​[etr​[θ​x∞]]\Phi^{\infty}(\theta):=\lim\_{t\to+\infty}\Phi(t,\theta,x\_{0})=\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\textup{tr}[\theta x\_{\infty}]}\right], is given for θ∈𝕊n\theta\in\mathbb{S}\_{n} by

Note that ([10](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.E10 "In Corollary 2.2. ‣ 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

The usual caveat applies.")) is the MGF of a matrix gamma distribution, and for diagonal parameters, the vector (x11,∞,…,xn​n,∞)(x\_{11,\infty},\ldots,x\_{nn,\infty}) is an nn-dimensional vector of independent scalar gamma variables such that xi​i,∞x\_{ii,\infty} has a scale 2​(ς∞)​i​i2(\varsigma\_{\infty}){ii} and shape β/2\beta/2. This type of distribution is used in Furman and Landsman ([2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib41 "Risk capital decomposition for a multivariate dependent gamma portfolio")) to analyse the TCE risk measure.  Since the components of the vector are independent, the authors express the losses as linear functions of this vector, with the dependence between losses captured by a common component of the vector gamma distribution. This common-factor perspective imposes a sign constraint on the dependencies between losses. Note that in the non-diagonal case, the components xi​i,∞x\_{ii,\infty} are dependent, and therefore it provides an alternative modeling strategy to create dependence compared to the one used in Furman and Landsman ([2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib41 "Risk capital decomposition for a multivariate dependent gamma portfolio")), which consists of specifying a common factor.

To compute the conditional risk measures, we will need the derivative of the MGF with respect to a scalar parameter that multiplies its matrix argument. This relies on Lax ([2007](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib48 "Linear algebra and its applications"), Theorem 4, p. 127) and Lax ([2007](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib48 "Linear algebra and its applications"), Theorem 2, p. 124).

###### Proposition 2.3.

Given a Wishart process (xt)t≥0(x\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} and for ϵ>0\epsilon>0 let ν∈ℝ\nu\in\mathbb{R} with ν∈]−ϵ,ϵ[\nu\in]-\epsilon,\;\epsilon[. Assume that θ0,θ1∈𝕊n\theta\_{0},\theta\_{1}\in\mathbb{S}\_{n} (that do not depend on ν\nu), and define the MGF

If we further assume that ω=β​σ2\omega=\beta\sigma^{2} with β∈ℝ\beta\in\mathbb{R} and β≥n+1\beta\geq n+1 then bν​(t,θ0,θ1)=β​tr​[(In−2​ςt​θ0)−1​ςt​θ1]b\_{\nu}(t,\theta\_{0},\theta\_{1})=\beta\textup{tr}[(I\_{n}-2\varsigma\_{t}\theta\_{0})^{-1}\varsigma\_{t}\theta\_{1}].

Note that for Φ¯​(t,ν,θ0,θ1,x0)\bar{\Phi}(t,\nu,\theta\_{0},\theta\_{1},x\_{0}) to be well-defined, the norm of θ0+ν​θ1\theta\_{0}+\nu\theta\_{1} needs to be sufficiently small. If ϵ\epsilon is sufficiently small and the norm of θ0\theta\_{0} is also sufficiently small, then the function is well-defined according to Proposition [2.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.Thmtheorem1 "Proposition 2.1. ‣ 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). Note also that if the norm of θ0\theta\_{0} is sufficiently small, then (In−2​θ0​ςt)(I\_{n}-2\theta\_{0}\varsigma\_{t}) is invertible since ςt∈𝕊n++\varsigma\_{t}\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{++}.

The above proposition gives the first order derivative of the moment generating function with respect to ν\nu. Below, we will need the q​-thq\text{-th} order derivative, where q∈ℕq\in\mathbb{N}, of this function with respect to this parameter.

###### Corollary 2.4.

Assume that ω=β​σ2\omega=\beta\sigma^{2} with β∈ℝ\beta\in\mathbb{R} and β≥n+1\beta\geq n+1 and let Φ¯(.,.,.,.)\bar{\Phi}(.,.,.,.) be given by ([11](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.E11 "In Proposition 2.3. ‣ 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")). Then the q​-thq\text{-th} order derivative of Φ¯​(t,ν,θ0,θ1,x0)\bar{\Phi}(t,\nu,\theta\_{0},\theta\_{1},x\_{0}) with respect to ν\nu (evaluated for ν=0\nu=0) is given by

The previous results can be extended to the MGF of the process at two different times thanks to the affine property of the Wishart process. Indeed, in addition to the MGF of the Wishart process at a given point in time, i.e., the marginal point of the process, it is of practical interest to consider two points in time 0<t0<t10<t\_{0}<t\_{1} and the MGF of (xt0,xt1)(x\_{t\_{0}},x\_{t\_{1}}). This will allow us to consider losses at two different dates, thus introducing an intertemporal  or time-lagged perspective to the risk measurement problem. It is easy to obtain the following result from Proposition [2.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.Thmtheorem1 "Proposition 2.1. ‣ 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

## 3 Conditional tail risk measures

In this section, we begin by reformulating the key quantities required to compute conditional higher moments in terms of their Fourier transform representations, as outlined in Section [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). While these Fourier transform representations of the tail conditional expectations may seem standard, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been previously reported in the literature in the multivariate and/or the higher order moments cases.444A Fourier transform representation of the TCE\operatorname{TCE} in the univariate case appears in Dufresne et al. ([2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib17 "Fourier inversion formulas in option pricing and insurance")). Even if they are of interest, these Fourier transform representations involve multidimensional integrations that are numerically demanding. As such, they do not provide an interesting alternative to conditional higher moments computed using the density of the state variable, which is the standard approach used in the literature. To overcome this difficulty, in Section [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") we introduce one-dimensional Fourier transform representations for these risk measures, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost. However, this comes at the cost of computing the (higher) derivative of the MGF of the Wishart process, but this can be done as shown in the previous section. Note that these results apply not only to the Wishart process, but to any distribution with a known MGF,555Throughout, we treat the MGF as a function of a complex parameter and work on the domain where it is finite. On the imaginary axis z=i​vz=\mathrm{i}v this coincides with the characteristic function φY​(v)=𝔼​[ei​v​Y]\varphi\_{Y}(v)=\mathbb{E}\!\left[e^{\mathrm{i}vY}\right], which always exists. Unless stated otherwise, “MGF” refers to this complex-argument version. so these results have broad applicability that goes well beyond the particular case of the Wishart process that we use here. We begin by presenting the Fourier transform representations of the risk measures in a very general way in Section [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

We end this section by providing a comparison, in terms of computational cost, of our approach with the standard strategy used in the literature.

### 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures

When considering only one loss or a scalar loss, then the standard risk measures are the higher moments conditional on the loss being above a certain threshold. By Bayes’ theorem we have the following expression for the moment of a variable YY conditional on the fact that this variable is above a certain threshold:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[Yp​|Y>​y∗]=𝔼​[Yp​𝟏{Y>y∗}]𝔼​[𝟏{Y>y∗}],\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[Y^{p}|Y>y\_{\*}]=\frac{\mathbb{E}[Y^{p}\mathbf{1}\_{\{Y>y\_{\*}\}}]}{\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}\_{\{Y>y\_{\*}\}}]}, |  | (19) |

which for p=1p=1 is commonly denoted in the literature as TCEY⁡(y∗)\operatorname{TCE}\_{Y}(y\_{\*}) and is the tail conditional expectation. Thus, the evaluation of ([19](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E19 "In 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) amounts to the calculation of 𝔼​[Yp​𝟏{Y>y∗}]\mathbb{E}[Y^{p}\mathbf{1}\_{\{Y>y\_{\*}\}}], which is commonly done using the density of the variable YY. We reformulate this expectation in terms of the MGF of this variable, thus avoiding the use of its density. The proposition below shows how to calculate this.

###### Proposition 3.1.

Denote YY a positive (scalar) random variable and denote by ΦY​(v)=𝔼​[ev​Y]\Phi\_{Y}(v)=\mathbb{E}\left[e^{vY}\right] for v∈ℝv\in\mathbb{R} its MGF. Let y∗∈ℝ+y\_{\*}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+}, α1∈ℝ+\alpha\_{1}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+} and assume u1∈ℝ→ΦY​(α1−i​u1)(α1−i​u1)j+1u\_{1}\in\mathbb{R}\to\frac{\Phi\_{Y}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}} (with i=−1\mathrm{i}=\sqrt{-1}) is integrable for j=0,…,pj=0,\ldots,p with p∈ℕp\in\mathbb{N}. Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[Yp​𝟏{Y>y∗}]=∫0+∞∑j=0p(pj)​y∗p−j​cjπ​ℜ⁡(e−(α1−i​u1)​y∗​ΦY​(α1−i​u1)(α1−i​u1)j+1)​d​u1,\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[Y^{p}\mathbf{1}\_{\{Y>y\_{\*}\}}]=\int\_{0}^{+\infty}\sum\_{j=0}^{p}\binom{p}{j}\frac{y\_{\*}^{p-j}c\_{j}}{\pi}\Re\left(\frac{e^{-(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})y\_{\*}}\Phi\_{Y}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}}\right)du\_{1}, |  | (20) |

with cj=Γ​(j+1)c\_{j}=\Gamma(j+1) and Γ(.)\Gamma(.) the gamma function.

###### Proof.

We have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[Yp​𝟏{Y>y∗}]\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[Y^{p}\mathbf{1}\_{\{Y>y\_{\*}\}}] | =∑j=0p(pj)​𝔼​[(Y−y∗)+j]​y∗p−j,\displaystyle=\sum\_{j=0}^{p}\binom{p}{j}\mathbb{E}[(Y-y\_{\*})\_{+}^{j}]y\_{\*}^{p-j}, |  |

and define V=Y−y∗V=Y-y\_{\*} so that 𝔼​[(Y−y∗)+j]=𝔼​[(V)+j]\mathbb{E}[(Y-y\_{\*})\_{+}^{j}]=\mathbb{E}[(V)\_{+}^{j}]. Bateman and Erdélyi ([1954](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib46 "Tables of integral transforms"), 3.2(3))  is

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2​π​(v)+j+1−1​e−α1​vΓ​(j+1)=∫−∞+∞e−i​v​u1(α1−i​u1)j+1​𝑑u1,\displaystyle\frac{2\pi(v)\_{+}^{j+1-1}e^{-\alpha\_{1}v}}{\Gamma(j+1)}=\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{e^{-\mathrm{i}vu\_{1}}}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}}du\_{1}, |  | (21) |

with α1>0\alpha\_{1}>0. After reorganizing the terms, multiplying by the density of VV that we denote g​(v)g(v), integrating with respect to the variable vv we reach

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ∫−∞+∞(v)+j​g​(v)​𝑑v=Γ​(j+1)2​π​∫−∞+∞∫−∞+∞eα1​v​e−i​v​u1(α1−i​u1)j+1​g​(v)​𝑑u1​𝑑v,\displaystyle\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}(v)\_{+}^{j}g(v)dv=\frac{\Gamma(j+1)}{2\pi}\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{e^{\alpha\_{1}v}e^{-\mathrm{i}vu\_{1}}}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}}g(v)du\_{1}dv, |  | (22) |

and the above equality rewrites as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[(V)+j]\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[(V)\_{+}^{j}] | =∫−∞+∞Γ​(j+1)2​π​∫−∞+∞eα1​v​e−i​u1​v(α1−i​u1)j+1​𝑑u1​g​(v)​𝑑v\displaystyle=\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\Gamma(j+1)}{2\pi}\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{e^{\alpha\_{1}v}e^{-\mathrm{i}u\_{1}v}}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}}du\_{1}g(v)dv |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | =∫−∞+∞Γ​(j+1)2​π​1(α1−i​u1)j+1​∫−∞+∞e(α1−i​u1)​v​g​(v)​𝑑v​𝑑u1\displaystyle=\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\Gamma(j+1)}{2\pi}\frac{1}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}}\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})v}g(v)dvdu\_{1} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | =∫−∞+∞Γ​(j+1)2​π​𝔼​[e(α1−i​u1)​V](α1−i​u1)j+1​𝑑u1,\displaystyle=\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\Gamma(j+1)}{2\pi}\frac{\mathbb{E}[e^{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})V}]}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}}du\_{1}, |  |

after applying Fubini’s theorem. Since 𝔼​[e(α1−i​u1)​V]=𝔼​[e(α1−i​u1)​Y]​e−(α1−i​u1)​y∗\mathbb{E}[e^{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})V}]=\mathbb{E}[e^{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})Y}]e^{-(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})y\_{\*}} we obtain

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[(Y−y∗)+j]=Γ​(j+1)2​π​∫−∞+∞e−(α1−i​u1)​y∗​ΦY​(α1−i​u1)(α1−i​u1)j+1​𝑑u1,\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[(Y-y\_{\*})\_{+}^{j}]=\frac{\Gamma(j+1)}{2\pi}\int\_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{e^{-(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})y\_{\*}}\Phi\_{Y}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}}du\_{1}, |  |

that leads to the result after considering the real part of the right hand side of the above equation since the left hand side is real. Note that to apply Fubini’s theorem, it requires the integrability of u1∈ℝ→ΦY​(α1−i​u1)(α1−i​u1)j+1u\_{1}\in\mathbb{R}\to\frac{\Phi\_{Y}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}},  which depends on the MGF of the variable YY.
∎

Note that the result applies to distributions defined not only on ℝ+\mathbb{R}\_{+}, but also on ℝ\mathbb{R}, provided the integrability condition is satisfied, and if we opted to use the characteristic function φY​(v)=𝔼​[ei​v​Y]\varphi\_{Y}(v)=\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\mathrm{i}vY}\right] (which always exists for real vv) instead of the MGF ΦY​(v)=𝔼​[ev​Y]\Phi\_{Y}(v)=\mathbb{E}\left[e^{vY}\right], it would amount to changing ΦY​(α1−i​u1)\Phi\_{Y}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1}) in ([20](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E20 "In Proposition 3.1. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) to φY​(−i​α1−u1)\varphi\_{Y}(-\mathrm{i}\alpha\_{1}-u\_{1}). The proof remains unchanged. Since we use the MGF of the Wishart process (see, for example, Grasselli and Tebaldi ([2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib86 "Solvable affine term structure models")) and Alfonsi ([2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib37 "Affine diffusions and related processes: simulation, theory and applications"))), we formulate our results in terms of the MGF instead of the characteristic function. However, we stress that all results of this work can easily accommodate the characteristic function instead.

The above result already illustrates the advantage of using a Fourier representation of risk measures, since the above result applies for any p​-thp\text{-th} moment and any distribution with known MGF. But the result is far more interesting when considering the multivariate case. Indeed, if (Y1,⋯,Yn)(Y\_{1},\cdots,Y\_{n}) is a vector of losses and S=∑i=1nYiS=\sum\_{i=1}^{n}Y\_{i} is the sum of losses, only under very special loss distributions will the density of SS be known in closed form, whereas the MGF Φ(Y1,⋯,Yn)​(z1,⋯,zn)\Phi\_{(Y\_{1},\cdots,Y\_{n})}(z\_{1},\cdots,z\_{n}) of (Y1,⋯,Yn)(Y\_{1},\cdots,Y\_{n}) may be known, so that the MGF of SS is then known since ΦS​(z)=Φ(Y1,⋯,Yn)​(z,⋯,z)\Phi\_{S}(z)=\Phi\_{(Y\_{1},\cdots,Y\_{n})}(z,\cdots,z), and the aforementioned risk measures can be computed up to a one-dimensional integration.666If (Y1,⋯,Yn)(Y\_{1},\cdots,Y\_{n}) is a random vector with a known density, only for certain specific distributions the density of the sum S=∑1nYiS=\sum\_{1}^{n}Y\_{i} is known in closed form (it is the convolution). Further to this, in the multivariate case it is relevant to compute the moment of a product of given losses conditional on one of the loss, often the sum of the losses but it does not have to be the sum, being above a certain threshold. Proceeding as for ([19](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E19 "In 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

where ZZ is one element of (Y1,…,Yn)(Y\_{1},\ldots,Y\_{n}) or a linear combination of the elements of (Y1,…,Yn)(Y\_{1},\ldots,Y\_{n}) and therefore to determine the numerator of the above equation. Note that in ([23](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E23 "In 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

It is presented in the following proposition.

###### Proposition 3.2.

Let (Y,Z)∈ℝ+2(Y,Z)\in\mathbb{R}\_{+}^{2} a 2-dimensional random vector and denote by Φ(Y,Z)​(v1,v2)=𝔼​[ev1​Y+v2​Z]\Phi\_{(Y,Z)}(v\_{1},v\_{2})=\mathbb{E}[e^{v\_{1}Y+v\_{2}Z}] for (v1,v2)∈ℝ2(v\_{1},v\_{2})\in\mathbb{R}^{2} its MGF. Let y∗∈ℝ+y\_{\*}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+}, (α1,α2)∈ℝ+2(\alpha\_{1},\alpha\_{2})\in\mathbb{R}\_{+}^{2}. Assume suitable integrability conditions of the functions (u1,u2)∈ℝ2→Φ(Y,Z)​(α1−i​u1,α2−i​u2)(α1−i​u1)j+1​(α2−i​u2)p+1(u\_{1},u\_{2})\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\frac{\Phi\_{(Y,Z)}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1},\alpha\_{2}-\mathrm{i}u\_{2})}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}(\alpha\_{2}-\mathrm{i}u\_{2})^{p+1}} for j=0,…,pj=0,\ldots,p.

with cj=Γ​(j+1)c\_{j}=\Gamma(j+1) and cq=Γ​(q+1)c\_{q}=\Gamma(q+1).

and if we define V=Y−y∗V=Y-y\_{\*} we obtain 𝔼​[Zq​(Y−y∗)+j]=𝔼​[Zq​(V)+j]\mathbb{E}[Z^{q}(Y-y\_{\*})\_{+}^{j}]=\mathbb{E}[Z^{q}(V)\_{+}^{j}]. Using Bateman and Erdélyi ([1954](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib46 "Tables of integral transforms"), 3.2(3)), we reach

that provides the result after considering the real part of the right hand side of the above equation since the left hand side is real. Note that Fubini’s theorem requires the integrability of (u1,u2)∈ℝ2→Φ(Y,Z)​(α1−i​u1,α2−i​u2)(α1−i​u1)j+1​(α2−i​u2)q+1(u\_{1},u\_{2})\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\frac{\Phi\_{(Y,Z)}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1},\alpha\_{2}-\mathrm{i}u\_{2})}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}(\alpha\_{2}-\mathrm{i}u\_{2})^{q+1}}.
∎

Note that the previous two results apply to distributions defined not only on ℝ+2\mathbb{R}\_{+}^{2}, but also on ℝ2\mathbb{R}^{2}, provided the integrability conditions are satisfied and the following a minor adjustment to the proof is added. If ZZ has a distribution defined on ℝ\mathbb{R}, then writing z=(z)+−(−z)+z=(z)\_{+}-(-z)\_{+} so that zq=(z)+q−(−z)+qz^{q}=(z)\_{+}^{q}-(-z)\_{+}^{q}, the first term is handled using Bateman and Erdélyi ([1954](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib46 "Tables of integral transforms"), 3.2(3)) while the second term is handled using Bateman and Erdélyi ([1954](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib46 "Tables of integral transforms"), 3.2(4)).

We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) is the Plancherel-Parseval equality which states that the integral of the product of two functions is equal, up to a scaling parameter, to the integral of the product of the Fourier (or Laplace, Mellin) transform of these functions, see DLMF ([2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib45 "Digital library of mathematical functions"), Section 1.14). This equality is of practical importance since if the integral represents an expectation of a given function of a random variable, then this expectation can be expressed as the product of the function of the random variable and the density of this random variable. The Plancherel-Parseval equality implies that this expectation is given by the integral of the Fourier transform of the density, which is the characteristic function of the random variable, and the Fourier transform of the given function. If the density of the random variable is known, then the expectation can be computed using the density, and there is no need to rely on this Fourier representation. However, it can become quickly tedious. For example, Ignatieva and Landsman ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib43 "A class of generalised hyper-elliptical distributions and their applications in computing conditional tail risk measures")) compute the TCE for a class of generalized hyper-elliptical distributions, while in Ignatieva and Landsman ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib44 "Tail variance for generalised hyper-elliptical models")) they extend the computations to the second moment, that is, the tail variance. Higher order (conditional) moments have yet to be determined. If the density of the random variable is unknown (or challenging to compute numerically) but its MGF is known, there are two alternatives. The first consists in computing the density using the inverse
Fourier transform of the characteristic function and then to integrate (numerically) the density. This is done in Nguyen and Nguyen ([2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib9 "Risk measures computation by Fourier inversion")) or Blier-Wong et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib10 "Efficient evaluation of risk allocations")). Although it is a possible route, ([20](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E20 "In Proposition 3.1. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) suggest a better alternative solution, which consists in using the Plancherel-Parseval and integrate the product. To this end, one needs to compute the Fourier transform of function involved in the risk measure. For the TCE, this computation is well-known since it is standard in the option pricing literature, and not surprisingly, in Dufresne et al. ([2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib17 "Fourier inversion formulas in option pricing and insurance")), Bormetti et al. ([2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib11 "A generalized Fourier transform approach to risk measures")) or Kélani and Quittard-Pinon ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib12 "Pricing, hedging and assessing risk in a general Lévy context")), this link to this literature is explicitly underlined. As a result, our work extends the literature in two ways. First, we consider higher (conditional) moments as ([20](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E20 "In Proposition 3.1. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) clearly shows. Second, we consider the multivariate case in ([24](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E24 "In Proposition 3.2. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")). Note that this result applies to variables with a general distribution, particularly when these variables are the sum of other random variables, as is typical when considering a portfolio. In such situations, a computational approach based on the density can be problematic. Also, multidimensional problem often come with computational difficulties that we partially solve. We elaborate further on this point in the next section.

The above result requires a 2-dimensional integration, and if we consider more variables, but still conditioning on one of them, it will lead to a multi-dimensional Fourier transform (of dimension equal to the number of variables considered), and therefore to a numerical difficulty similar to that encountered when working with the density of a state variable used for the losses. The next section shows how this numerical difficulty can be replaced by a one-dimensional integration and derivation of a function that is related to the derivative of the MGF of the state variable. The difference is important since we have seen in the analytical section that the MGF of the Wishart process is easy to derive.

### 3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures

In this section, we reformulate Proposition [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem2 "Proposition 3.2. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") in a more efficient way from a numerical point of view. Essentially, it requires to be able to compute the derivative of the MGF of the state variable which can typically be done analytically.

Denote by Φ(Y,Z)(0,q)​(v1,v2)\Phi\_{(Y,Z)}^{(0,q)}(v\_{1},v\_{2}) for (v1,v2)∈ℝ2(v\_{1},v\_{2})\in\mathbb{R}^{2} its q​-thq\text{-th} order derivative, where q∈ℝq\in\mathbb{R}, with respect to v2v\_{2} (and 0​-th0\text{-th} order derivative with respect to v1v\_{1}). Let y∗∈ℝ+y\_{\*}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+}, α1∈ℝ+\alpha\_{1}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+} and assume suitable integrability conditions of the functions u1∈ℝ→Φ(Y,Z)(0,q)​(α1−i​u1,0)(α1−i​u1)j+1u\_{1}\in\mathbb{R}\to\frac{\Phi\_{(Y,Z)}^{(0,q)}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1},0)}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}} for j=0,…,pj=0,\ldots,p. Then the following relation holds

###### Proof.

Proceeding as in the previous proof but not using a Fourier transform for the variable ZZ, we can reach

with α1>0\alpha\_{1}>0. Rewrite 𝔼​[Zq​e(α1−i​u1)​Y]=dq​𝔼​[e(α1−i​u1)​Y+ν​Z]d​νq|ν=0=Φ(Y,Z)(0,q)​(α1−i​u1,0)\mathbb{E}[Z^{q}e^{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})Y}]=\frac{d^{q}\mathbb{E}\left[e^{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})Y+\nu Z}\right]}{d\nu^{q}}|\_{\nu=0}=\Phi\_{(Y,Z)}^{(0,q)}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1},0) and substituting this expression in the equation above we reach the result after taking the real part of the integral since the left hand side is real. Applying Fubini’s theorem requires the integrability of u1∈ℝ→𝔼​[Zq​e(α1−i​u1)​Y](α1−i​u1)j+1u\_{1}\in\mathbb{R}\to\frac{\mathbb{E}[Z^{q}e^{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})Y}]}{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})^{j+1}}.

Note that the above result applies to a variable defined on ℝ2\mathbb{R}^{2}.

The computation of the conditional higher moments ([23](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E23 "In 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

The proposition below provides a method to compute the cross moments of two variables, conditional on a third (dependent) variable. It is presented without proof, as it follows the same structure as the proof of Proposition [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem4 "Proposition 3.4. ‣ 3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")), it should be noted that any form of higher order moment or central moment can be constructed. These higher order moments are beneficial for analyzing tail risk properties. For example, the well known tail variance is defined as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[(Y−𝔼​[Y​|Y>​y∗])2​|Y>​y∗]=𝔼​[Y2​|Y>​y∗]−𝔼​[Y​|Y>​y∗]2,\mathbb{E}[(Y-\mathbb{E}[Y|Y>y\_{\*}])^{2}|Y>y\_{\*}]=\mathbb{E}[Y^{2}|Y>y\_{\*}]-\mathbb{E}[Y|Y>y\_{\*}]^{2}, |  |

and both terms can be calculated using Proposition [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem1 "Proposition 3.1. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). Note that this statement applies whether YY is a sum of losses or not.

The previous propositions apply to any random vector with a known MGF  and are particularly relevant when one of the variables is a sum of random variables, as is the case with the sum of losses in a portfolio. Note that only under very specific distributions for the losses will the sum have a tractable density. This makes any methodology based on the density difficult, if not impossible, to implement. In the next section, we show how the previous expressions can be specified when working with the Wishart process. Interestingly, its process property (i.e., its time dependence) and its positive definite matrix property offer new perspectives that can be effectively addressed using the Fourier transform representation of risk measures.

### 3.3 Wishart conditional tail risk measures

In the previous section, the results were presented in a very general form. Essentially, they require the MGF, the derivative of the MGF of the state variable, as well as some integrability conditions for these functions. The purpose of this section is to show that the Wishart process satisfies these requirements.

Let (x11,t,…,xn​n,t)(x\_{11,t},\ldots,x\_{nn,t}) be an n×1n\times 1 vector of losses, and assume that this vector is the diagonal of a Wishart process xtx\_{t} of size nn. Note that xi​i,t=tr​[θ1​xt]x\_{ii,t}=\textup{tr}[\theta\_{1}x\_{t}] with θ1=ei​i\theta\_{1}=e\_{ii}. A standard risk measure associated with xi​i,tx\_{ii,t} is the q​-thq\text{-th} moment of xi​i,tx\_{ii,t} conditional on xi​i,t>x∗x\_{ii,t}>x\_{\*} for a given x∗∈ℝ+x\_{\*}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+}. It is given by the following proposition.

###### Proposition 3.7.

Assume that ω=β​σ2\omega=\beta\sigma^{2} and let θ1=ei​i\theta\_{1}=e\_{ii} for i∈{1,…,n}i\in\{1,\ldots,n\} so that xi​i,t=tr​[θ1​xt]x\_{ii,t}=\textup{tr}[\theta\_{1}x\_{t}], then the q​-thq\text{-th} moment of tr​[θ1​xt]\textup{tr}[\theta\_{1}x\_{t}] conditional on tr​[θ1​xt]>x∗\textup{tr}[\theta\_{1}x\_{t}]>x\_{\*}, with x∗∈ℝ+x\_{\*}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+}, is given by

Note that when q=1q=1 in ([31](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E31 "In Proposition 3.9. ‣ 3.3 Wishart conditional tail risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

If we denote by st=∑i=1nxi​i,ts\_{t}=\sum\_{i=1}^{n}x\_{ii,t} the sum of those losses on a portfolio, it can also be written as tr​[θ1​xt]\textup{tr}[\theta\_{1}x\_{t}] with θ1=In\theta\_{1}=I\_{n}.

When considering several losses, the quantity of interest is the expected loss of the variable xi​i,tx\_{ii,t} conditional on the sum of losses being above a certain threshold, it is given by 𝔼​[xi​i,t​|st>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[x\_{ii,t}|s\_{t}>s\_{\*}]. An extension of this measure is the higher moments of xi​i,tx\_{ii,t} conditional on the sum of losses being above a certain threshold, i.e., 𝔼​[xi​i,tq​|st>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[x\_{ii,t}^{q}|s\_{t}>s\_{\*}]. But we can further extend from higher moments of xi​i,tx\_{ii,t} to higher cross-moments of (xi​i,t,st)(x\_{ii,t},s\_{t}) conditional on the sum of losses being above a certain threshold, i.e., 𝔼​[xi​i,tq​stp​|st>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[x\_{ii,t}^{q}s\_{t}^{p}|s\_{t}>s\_{\*}]. Thanks to the previous analytical results, these quantities are easy to obtain in our framework. In particular, the following proposition derives from Proposition [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem2 "Proposition 3.2. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

###### Proposition 3.8.

Assume that ω=β​σ2\omega=\beta\sigma^{2} and let θ0=∑i=1nei​i\theta\_{0}=\sum\_{i=1}^{n}e\_{ii} and θ1=ei​i\theta\_{1}=e\_{ii} for i∈{1,…,n}i\in\{1,\ldots,n\} so that st=tr​[θ0​xt]s\_{t}=\textup{tr}[\theta\_{0}x\_{t}] and xi​i,t=tr​[θ1​xt]x\_{ii,t}=\textup{tr}[\theta\_{1}x\_{t}].

after using Jensen’s inequality. Taking α0>0\alpha\_{0}>0 and α1>0\alpha\_{1}>0 but sufficiently small, using similar arguments as in the previous proposition we reach that 𝔼​[etr​[(α0​θ0+α1​θ1)​xt]]<∞\mathbb{E}[e^{\textup{tr}[(\alpha\_{0}\theta\_{0}+\alpha\_{1}\theta\_{1})x\_{t}]}]<\infty and, therefore, that the integrand in the numerator of ([30](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E30 "In Proposition 3.8. ‣ 3.3 Wishart conditional tail risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

When j=0j=0, we proceed as in the previous proposition to establish the integrability.

As previously mentioned, the above result is of interest but it involves a multi-dimensional integration.

Then the (p​-th,q​-th)(p\text{-th},q\text{-th}) moment of (tr​[θ0​xt],tr​[θ1​xt])(\textup{tr}[\theta\_{0}x\_{t}],\textup{tr}[\theta\_{1}x\_{t}]) conditional on the event st>s∗s\_{t}>s\_{\*}, with s∗∈ℝ+s\_{\*}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+}, can be written as

Note that no order is specified on θ1\theta\_{1} and θ2\theta\_{2}, and so we can interchange these matrices at will. This means we can easily compute the cross-moments by conditioning on the individual losses xi​i,tx\_{ii,t} or on the portfolio itself ∑i=1nxi​i,t\sum\_{i=1}^{n}x\_{ii,t}.

Still in a portfolio perspective, in our framework we not only specify the distribution of losses but also their dependencies, which can be used to perform conditioning. Let θ0=(e12+e21)/2\theta\_{0}=(e\_{12}+e\_{21})/2, then x12,t=tr​[θ0​xt]x\_{12,t}=\textup{tr}[\theta\_{0}x\_{t}]. Similarly, let θ1=e11\theta\_{1}=e\_{11} and θ2=e22\theta\_{2}=e\_{22}, so that x11,t=tr​[θ1​xt]x\_{11,t}=\textup{tr}[\theta\_{1}x\_{t}] and x22,t=tr​[θ2​xt]x\_{22,t}=\textup{tr}[\theta\_{2}x\_{t}]. We can then calculate

|  | 𝔼​[x11,tp​x22,tq​|x12,t>​x∗],\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[x\_{11,t}^{p}x\_{22,t}^{q}|x\_{12,t}>x\_{\*}], |  | (32) |

which is the expected cross-moment of the first loss and the second loss conditional on the covariance between these losses being above a certain threshold. This example exploits the positive definite matrix nature of the Wishart process. The proposition below is an application of Proposition [3.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem5 "Proposition 3.5. ‣ 3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") demonstrate how to compute higher (conditional) cross-moments. The Wishart distribution is an example of a distribution for which computing these risk measures using the density leads to significant numerical difficulties, and in particular when the conditioning variable in the sum of dependent losses. Note also that the framework, both the methodology and the chosen distribution on the space of symmetric positive definite matrices, allows for the determination of these risk measures even when one (or several) of the variables controlling the dependency of the distribution is involved. This dependency can be fairly general; in particular, it can take any sign, which contrasts with existing results (see Furman and Landsman ([2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib41 "Risk capital decomposition for a multivariate dependent gamma portfolio"), Definition 1, Condition 5) or Blier-Wong et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib10 "Efficient evaluation of risk allocations"), Examples 6.1 and 6.2)), where there is a sign constraint because the state variable is a vector of independent random variables, and the dependence derives from one of the variable being a common factor to the losses.

Let us mention the two recent interesting works Arias-Serna et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib14 "Risk measures: A generalization from the univariate to the matrix-variate")) and Arias-Serna et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib13 "Matrix-variate risk measures under Wishart and gamma distributions")), which compute the VaR, not a coherent risk measure, using the density of the state variable following a Wishart distribution. Compared to these works, the above formula give conditional higher moments, and by formulating the problem in terms of the MGF, the methodology remains numerically simple to implement since the density of the Wishart process, besides depending of many variables, involves a special function of matrix argument that is challenging to evaluate. In contrast, the MGF of the Wishart distribution only involves the ratio of matrices and the determinant of matrices, both functions are simple to derive. This aspect is crucial to obtain the above formulas.

The above propositions, while daunting at first glance, are easily computable in most programming languages.

#### 3.3.1 The two dates case

We can take advantage of the time-dependent nature of the Wishart process by considering losses at two different dates. In this particular case, one is interested in the intertemporal or time-lagged properties of the risk measures, which are most often analyzed using static distributions.  This perspective relates to the time-series literature on risk measures, see for example, Chavez-Demoulin and Guillou ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib3 "Extreme quantile estimation for β-mixing time series and applications")) or Goegebeur and Guillou ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib5 "A conditional tail expectation type risk measure for time series")). Interestingly, it can also be related the literature on (multivariate) count processes (such as the Cox process), where one models two (or more) events (in our case, losses), and their dependence (see Lu et al. ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib18 "Cyber risk modeling: a discrete multivariate count process approach"))). The temporal nature of this problem often involves leveraging the autocorrelation of a single loss or the correlation between two types of losses occurring at different times. Within the context of the present work, this translates as follows.

Given two dates t0,t1∈ℝ+t\_{0},t\_{1}\in\mathbb{R}\_{+} such that 0<t0<t10<t\_{0}<t\_{1}, we are interested in the quantities 𝔼​[xi​i,t1q​|xi​i,t0>​x∗]\mathbb{E}\left[x\_{ii,t\_{1}}^{q}|x\_{ii,t\_{0}}>x\_{\*}\right], 𝔼​[st1p​|st0>​s∗]\mathbb{E}\left[s\_{t\_{1}}^{p}|s\_{t\_{0}}>s\_{\*}\right], 𝔼​[st1p​xi​i,t1q​|st0>​s∗]\mathbb{E}\left[s\_{t\_{1}}^{p}x\_{ii,t\_{1}}^{q}|s\_{t\_{0}}>s\_{\*}\right] with x∗>0x\_{\*}>0, s∗>0s\_{\*}>0 and p,q∈ℕp,q\in\mathbb{N}. For example, the first (conditional) expectation represents the expected value of the q​-thq\text{-th} moment of the ithi^{\text{th}} loss at time t1t\_{1} conditional on the event that at the previous time t0t\_{0} this loss was greater than x∗x\_{\*}. The other expectations can be interpreted in a similar way.

### 3.4 A note on numerical precision

In this section, we contextualize our results within the broader literature. We first show how our formulae align with common notational conventions, and then demonstrate how they can be applied to well-known distributions whose MGFs are already established in the literature.

A commonly encountered quantity is the TCE of a random variable YY at a threshold y∗y\_{\*} that is defined as:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | TCEY⁡(y∗)=𝔼​[Y​∣Y>​y∗].\operatorname{TCE}\_{Y}(y\_{\*})=\mathbb{E}[Y\mid Y>y\_{\*}]. |  |

Using ([19](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E19 "In 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) and Proposition [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem1 "Proposition 3.1. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."), we can compute TCEY⁡(y∗)\operatorname{TCE}\_{Y}(y\_{\*}) exactly from the MGF ΦY​(⋅)\Phi\_{Y}(\cdot). This approach involves no approximation other than standard numerical integration. Notably, this method also extends to the sum of dependent random variables, S=∑i=1nYiS=\sum\_{i=1}^{n}Y\_{i}, provided the MGF Φ(Y1,…,Yn)​(⋅,…,⋅)\Phi\_{(Y\_{1},...,Y\_{n})}(\cdot,...,\cdot) is known since ΦS​(z)=Φ(Y1,…,Yn)​(z,…,z)\Phi\_{S}(z)=\Phi\_{(Y\_{1},...,Y\_{n})}(z,...,z) for z∈ℝz\in\mathbb{R} is known. Thus, the approach remains entirely general.

One might argue that numerical integration is an approximation. However, it is important to emphasize that most ‘closed-form’ results in the literature already involve integrals that must be evaluated numerically. For example, consider the generalized hyperbolic (GH) distribution of Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")), where a random vector is defined to be a GH distribution, (Y1,…,Yn)∼G​Hn​(λ,χ,ψ,𝝁,Σ,𝜸)(Y\_{1},...,Y\_{n})\sim GH\_{n}(\lambda,\chi,\psi,\boldsymbol{\mu},\Sigma,\boldsymbol{\gamma}), if its MGF is given for 𝐯∈ℝn\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{R}^{n} by

where Kλ​(⋅)K\_{\lambda}(\cdot) is the modified Bessel function of the third kind, see Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family"), Eq. (2.6)). Our integral-based approach can directly use this MGF and the known derivatives of Kλ​(⋅)K\_{\lambda}(\cdot) (see DLMF ([2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib45 "Digital library of mathematical functions"), Eq. (10.29.2))) to produce all desired tail measures without further approximation. Alternatively, the key result from Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")) computes the TCE of a (univariate) GH distribution through their Theorem 3.1, which is

where y∗y\_{\*} is the qq level quantile and the density y→fGH1​(y;λ,χ,ψ,μ,σ2,γ)y\to f\_{\mathrm{GH}\_{1}}(y;\lambda,\chi,\psi,\mu,\sigma^{2},\gamma) takes the form of

where det​(Σ)12=σ\textup{det}(\Sigma)^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sigma, and Q=(y−μ)2​σ−2Q=(y-\mu)^{2}\sigma^{-2}, see Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family"), Eq. (2.7)). The survival function F¯GH1​(yq;λ+1,χ,ψ,μ,σ2,γ)\bar{F}\_{\mathrm{GH}\_{1}}(y\_{q};\lambda+1,\chi,\psi,\mu,\sigma^{2},\gamma) of the GH distribution is given by 1 minus the integral of the density function fG​H1​(yq;λ+1,χ,ψ,μ,σ2,γ)f\_{GH\_{1}}(y\_{q};\lambda+1,\chi,\psi,\mu,\sigma^{2},\gamma) and kλk\_{\lambda} is a constant satisfying

As we can see, Theorem 3.1 of Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")) requires an integration due to the survival function F¯G​H1​(y)\bar{F}\_{GH\_{1}}(y), where our results also only require a one-dimensional integration. However, our approach also has the flexibility to calculate conditional higher moments as we shall see below.

When considering a sum of losses, the TCE of the sum can be computed thanks to a formula of the form ([36](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E36 "In 3.4 A note on numerical precision ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) since if (Y1,…,Yn)∼G​Hn​(λ,χ,ψ,𝝁,Σ,𝜸)(Y\_{1},...,Y\_{n})\sim GH\_{n}(\lambda,\chi,\psi,\boldsymbol{\mu},\Sigma,\boldsymbol{\gamma}) then S=∑i=1nYiS=\sum\_{i=1}^{n}Y\_{i} follows the distribution G​H1​(λ,χ,ψ,1⊤​𝝁,1⊤​Σ​1,1⊤​𝜸)GH\_{1}(\lambda,\chi,\psi,\textbf{1}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\mu},\textbf{1}^{\top}\Sigma\textbf{1},\textbf{1}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\gamma}) with 1=(1,…,1)⊤\textbf{1}=(1,\ldots,1)^{\top} an nn-dimensional vector of ones. It is this property of the GH distribution that ensures a simple expression for the density of the sum that keeps the computation of the TCE a one-dimensional integration problem even in the multivariate case. Note that for many distributions, and in particular for the Wishart distribution, the density of the sum does not admit a simple expression, making the computation of the TCE of the sum challenging.

Furthermore, Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family"), Theorem 3.2) show that the TCE of the sum can be decomposed as a sum of expectations of losses conditional on the sum being above a certain threshold. These conditional expectations are of the form 𝔼​[Yi​|S>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[Y\_{i}|S>s\_{\*}] and thanks to the property of the GH distribution they can admit an expression of the form ([36](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E36 "In 3.4 A note on numerical precision ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) (with adjusted parameters). From a numerical point of view, it amounts to perform several one-dimensional integrations. With our approach, since the MGF of (Y1,…,Yn)(Y\_{1},...,Y\_{n}) is known, the results can also be obtained at the same numerical cost.777A worked-out implementation of the TCE\operatorname{TCE} for the GH distribution, computed using the density as in Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")) and our approach, is provided in the supplementary appendix.

Thus, the numerical cost, the precision and accuracy of our results are comparable to, and in many cases equivalent to, methods currently in use. However, our approach applies to distributions for which the density of the sum is not simple to compute, and the Wishart distribution is one of them.

As previously noted, our approach not only applies to a wide range of distributions but also enables the computation of conditional higher moments, as demonstrated in the following section.

### 3.5 Conditional higher moments tail risk measures

Beyond the TCE, our methodology readily extends to other tail-based risk measures, and when considering the risk measures of a sum of losses, it naturally introduces conditional higher moments of losses.

##### The Tail variance (TV):

The tail variance, defined as the conditional second central moment given Y>y∗Y>y\_{\*}, can be written as:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | TVY⁡(y∗)=𝔼​[(Y−𝔼​[Y​|Y>​y∗])2​∣Y>​y∗]=𝔼​[Y2​∣Y>​y∗]−(𝔼​[Y​∣Y>​y∗])2.\displaystyle\operatorname{TV}\_{Y}(y\_{\*})=\mathbb{E}[(Y-\mathbb{E}[Y|Y>y\_{\*}])^{2}\mid Y>y\_{\*}]=\mathbb{E}[Y^{2}\mid Y>y\_{\*}]-(\mathbb{E}[Y\mid Y>y\_{\*}])^{2}. |  | (40) |

Both 𝔼​[Y2​∣Y>​y∗]\mathbb{E}[Y^{2}\mid Y>y\_{\*}] and 𝔼​[Y​∣Y>​y∗]\mathbb{E}[Y\mid Y>y\_{\*}] are computable using our framework as aforementioned. Whether YY is an individual loss or a sum of losses has no impact on the computational cost. However, when YY is a sum of losses, it naturally introduces the tail covariance.

##### The Tail covariance (TCov):

Consider the sum S=Y1+Y2S=Y\_{1}+Y\_{2} of two losses, we illustrate the problem using two losses but the results can be extended to higher dimension, and assume that the MGF Φ(Y1,Y2)\Phi\_{(Y\_{1},Y\_{2})} is known. As mentioned above, we can compute TCES⁡(s∗)\operatorname{TCE}\_{S}(s^{\*}), and we can also decompose it into individual contributions since we have:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | TCES⁡(s∗)=𝔼​[Y1​|S>​s∗]+𝔼​[Y2​|S>​s∗].\operatorname{TCE}\_{S}(s^{\*})=\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}|S>s\_{\*}]+\mathbb{E}[Y\_{2}|S>s\_{\*}]. |  |

This decomposition helps in understanding the contribution of each component variable to the tail behavior of the sum. This quantity can be calculated using Proposition [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem4 "Proposition 3.4. ‣ 3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). Then considering the tail variance risk of the sum, it leads to a decomposition of the form:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | TVS⁡(s∗)=TVY1+Y2⁡(s∗)=TVY1|S⁡(s∗)+TVY2|S⁡(s∗)+2​TCovY1,Y2|S⁡(s∗),\displaystyle\operatorname{TV}\_{S}(s\_{\*})=\operatorname{TV}\_{Y\_{1}+Y\_{2}}(s\_{\*})=\operatorname{TV}\_{Y\_{1}|S}(s\_{\*})+\operatorname{TV}\_{Y\_{2}|S}(s\_{\*})+2\operatorname{TCov}\_{Y\_{1},Y\_{2}|S}(s\_{\*}), |  | (41) |

where TVY1|S⁡(s∗)=𝔼​[(Y1−𝔼​[Y1​|S>​s∗])2​∣S>​s∗]=𝔼​[Y12​∣S>​s∗]−𝔼​[Y1​|S>​s∗]2\operatorname{TV}\_{Y\_{1}|S}(s\_{\*})=\mathbb{E}[(Y\_{1}-\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}|S>s\_{\*}])^{2}\mid S>s\_{\*}]=\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}^{2}\mid S>s\_{\*}]-\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}|S>s\_{\*}]^{2}, a similar equation for TVY2|S⁡(s∗)\operatorname{TV}\_{Y\_{2}|S}(s\_{\*}), and the tail covariance defined as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | TCovY1,Y2|S⁡(s∗)=𝔼​[Y1​Y2​∣S>​s∗]−𝔼​[Y1​∣S>​s∗]​𝔼​[Y2​∣S>​s∗],\displaystyle\operatorname{TCov}\_{Y\_{1},Y\_{2}|S}(s\_{\*})=\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}Y\_{2}\mid S>s\_{\*}]-\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}\mid S>s\_{\*}]\mathbb{E}[Y\_{2}\mid S>s\_{\*}], |  | (42) |

which provides insight into how dependence structures behave in the tail regions. Using our Proposition [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem4 "Proposition 3.4. ‣ 3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") and Proposition [3.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem5 "Proposition 3.5. ‣ 3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."), all these conditional expectations can be exactly computed using one-dimensional integrations. Note that TCovY1,S|S⁡(s∗)\operatorname{TCov}\_{Y\_{1},S|S}(s\_{\*}) corresponds to the tail covariance risk measure of Furman and Landsman ([2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib21 "Tail variance premium with applications for elliptical portfolio of risks"), Eq. (1.12)).

This showcases how joint distributions can yield decompositions of more complex tail risk measures, in particular for moments higher than two.

##### The Tail skewness (TS):

Following the definition of the tail variance, it is natural to define the tail skewness as:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | TSY⁡(y∗)=𝔼​[(Y−𝔼​[Y​|Y>​y∗])3​∣Y>​y∗](𝔼​[(Y−𝔼​[Y​|Y>​y∗])2​∣Y>​y∗])3/2.\displaystyle\operatorname{TS}\_{Y}(y\_{\*})=\frac{\mathbb{E}[(Y-\mathbb{E}[Y|Y>y\_{\*}])^{3}\mid Y>y\_{\*}]}{\left(\mathbb{E}[(Y-\mathbb{E}[Y|Y>y\_{\*}])^{2}\mid Y>y\_{\*}]\right)^{3/2}}. |  | (43) |

It can similarly be computed once we have the higher conditional moments, all available via our integral transforms.

If we consider the tail skewness of the sum S=Y1+Y2S=Y\_{1}+Y\_{2} of two losses, then the denominator of ([43](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E43 "In The Tail skewness (TS): ‣ 3.5 Conditional higher moments tail risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) is simply TVS⁡(s∗)\operatorname{TV}\_{S}(s\_{\*}) given by ([41](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E41 "In The Tail covariance (TCov): ‣ 3.5 Conditional higher moments tail risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")), and straightforward computations show that the numerator of ([43](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E43 "In The Tail skewness (TS): ‣ 3.5 Conditional higher moments tail risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) can be decomposed as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[(S−𝔼​[S​|S>​s∗])3​∣S>​s∗]\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[(S-\mathbb{E}[S|S>s\_{\*}])^{3}\mid S>s\_{\*}] | =𝔼​[Y13​∣S>​s∗]+3​𝔼​[Y12​Y2​∣S>​s∗]+3​𝔼​[Y1​Y22​∣S>​s∗]\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}^{3}\mid S>s\_{\*}]+3\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}^{2}Y\_{2}\mid S>s\_{\*}]+3\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}Y\_{2}^{2}\mid S>s\_{\*}] |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | +𝔼[Y23∣S>s∗]−3TVS(s∗)TCES(s∗)+2TCES(s∗)3,\displaystyle+\mathbb{E}[Y\_{2}^{3}\mid S>s\_{\*}]-3\operatorname{TV}\_{S}(s\_{\*})\operatorname{TCE}\_{S}(s\_{\*})+2\operatorname{TCE}\_{S}(s\_{\*})^{3}, |  |

with these conditional higher joint moments of Y1,Y2Y\_{1},Y\_{2}, that is, conditional expectations of the form 𝔼​[Y1p​Y2q​|S>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[Y\_{1}^{p}Y\_{2}^{q}|S>s\_{\*}] with p,q∈ℕp,q\in\mathbb{N} and p+q=3p+q=3, computed thanks to our Proposition [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem4 "Proposition 3.4. ‣ 3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

This latter conditional expectation is named tail joint moment in Yang et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib27 "Tail moments and tail joint moments for multivariate generalized hyperbolic distribution"), Eq. (1.4)) and is a building block for the tail joint central moment in Yang et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib27 "Tail moments and tail joint moments for multivariate generalized hyperbolic distribution"), Eq. (1.5)). The tail skewness appears in Yang et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib27 "Tail moments and tail joint moments for multivariate generalized hyperbolic distribution")) (where it is named tail conditional skewness (TCS)), this work also defines the tail conditional kurtosis that can be handled in our framework.888A worked-out implementation of the TV\operatorname{TV} for the GH distribution, computed using the density as in Ignatieva and Landsman ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib44 "Tail variance for generalised hyper-elliptical models")) and our approach, is provided in the supplementary appendix. This appendix also contains an implementation of TS\operatorname{TS} using our approach, since it has not yet been derived using the density.

## 4 Numerical experiments

In this section, we present a numerical implementation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulas. We begin by detailing the implementation steps that control the dependency between losses in our model. Since our approach relies on the MGF of the state variable rather than its density, we also briefly review the well-known results that allow us to recover the key quantities used in risk measurement.

### 4.1 Implementation details

In this section, we consider the two-dimensional case n=2n=2 and illustrate our results using the synthetic parameters listed in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

We set β\beta in accordance with the Bru case as defined by Bru ([1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib85 "Wishart processes")) for computational efficiency. Additionally, we set the initial value x0x\_{0} to be the mean value of the stationary solution of the stochastic differential equation ([1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.E1 "In 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

This solution is well defined since it is a Lyapunov equation and we assume that the eigenvalues of mm have negative real parts (β​σ2\beta\sigma^{2} is a symmetric definite positive matrix by construction).

From ([1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.E1 "In 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks.

|  | d​⟨x11,.,x11,.⟩t\displaystyle d\langle x\_{11,.},x\_{11,.}\rangle\_{t} | =4​x11,t​(σ112+σ122)​d​t,\displaystyle=4x\_{11,t}(\sigma\_{11}^{2}+\sigma\_{12}^{2})dt, |  | (44) |

|  |  |  |  |  |

If x11x\_{11} and x22x\_{22} represent two losses, their dependence is controlled by ([47](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E47 "In 4.1 Implementation details ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

Setting σ12=0\sigma\_{12}=0 results in a null instantaneous covariation. However, ([46](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E46 "In 4.1 Implementation details ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

The sign of this dependence is determined by the sign of σ12\sigma\_{12}, which can be positive or negative as σ∈𝕊2++\sigma\in\mathbb{S}\_{2}^{++}. If σ12=0\sigma\_{12}=0, then σ2\sigma^{2} is a diagonal matrix (i.e., (σ2)12=0(\sigma^{2})\_{12}=0). Note that if we wish to change to zero the dependence between x11,tx\_{11,t} and x22,tx\_{22,t}, setting σ12=0\sigma\_{12}=0 also inadvertently lowers the quadratic variation of x11,tx\_{11,t} and x22,tx\_{22,t} (given by ([44](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E44 "In 4.1 Implementation details ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) and ([45](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E45 "In 4.1 Implementation details ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."))). Thus, to counteract this effect, we introduce a new matrix called σ~\tilde{\sigma} defined by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | σ~=(σ~11σ~12σ~12σ~22)=(σ112+σ12200σ222+σ122),\tilde{\sigma}=\begin{pmatrix}\tilde{\sigma}\_{11}&\tilde{\sigma}\_{12}\\ \tilde{\sigma}\_{12}&\tilde{\sigma}\_{22}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\sqrt{\sigma\_{11}^{2}+\sigma\_{12}^{2}}&0\\ 0&\sqrt{\sigma\_{22}^{2}+\sigma\_{12}^{2}}\end{pmatrix}, |  | (48) |

and define a Wishart process x~t\tilde{x}\_{t} with dynamic given by ([1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.E1 "In 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) but with σ\sigma replaced with σ~\tilde{\sigma}. We call this process the zero-dependent equivalent (to xtx\_{t}) process since, by construction, we have

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​⟨x~11,.,x~11,.⟩tx~11,t\displaystyle\frac{d\langle\tilde{x}\_{11,.},\tilde{x}\_{11,.}\rangle\_{t}}{\tilde{x}\_{11,t}} | =σ112+σ122=d​⟨x11,.,x11,.⟩tx11,t,\displaystyle=\sigma\_{11}^{2}+\sigma\_{12}^{2}=\frac{d\langle x\_{11,.},x\_{11,.}\rangle\_{t}}{x\_{11,t}}, |  | (49) |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​⟨x~11,.,x~22,.⟩t\displaystyle d\langle\tilde{x}\_{11,.},\tilde{x}\_{22,.}\rangle\_{t} | =0,\displaystyle=0, |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​⟨x~22,.,x~22,.⟩tx~22,t\displaystyle\frac{d\langle\tilde{x}\_{22,.},\tilde{x}\_{22,.}\rangle\_{t}}{\tilde{x}\_{22,t}} | =σ122+σ222=d​⟨x22,.,x22,.⟩tx22,t.\displaystyle=\sigma\_{12}^{2}+\sigma\_{22}^{2}=\frac{d\langle x\_{22,.},x\_{22,.}\rangle\_{t}}{x\_{22,t}}. |  |

The process x~t\tilde{x}\_{t} allows us to quantify the impact of the dependence between x11,tx\_{11,t} and x22,tx\_{22,t} by changing the value of σ12\sigma\_{12} but keeping the quadratic variations unchanged.

In many applications, we need to find x∗x\_{\*} for a given (scalar) variable XX and α∈]0, 1[\alpha\in]0,\;1[ such that 𝔼​[𝟏{X>x∗}]=α\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}\_{\{X>x\_{\*}\}}]=\alpha. In these applications, XX is defined as X=tr​[θ​xt]X=\mathrm{tr}[\theta x\_{t}] with θ∈𝕊n+\theta\in\mathbb{S}\_{n}^{+}, making XX a positive random variable. The Laplace transform of XX is given by ℒX​(z)=𝔼​[e−z​X]=Φ​(t,−z​θ,x0)\mathcal{L}\_{X}(z)=\mathbb{E}[e^{-zX}]=\Phi(t,-z\theta,x\_{0}) for z>0z>0, where Φ​(⋅,⋅,⋅)\Phi(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot) is defined by ([4](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.E4 "In Proposition 2.1. ‣ 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")). Using the inverse Laplace transform, the cumulative distribution function of XX is:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | FX​(u)=1π​i​∫γ¯−i0γ¯+i​∞ℜ⁡(eu​z​ℒX​(z)z)​𝑑z,F\_{X}(u)=\frac{1}{\pi\mathrm{i}}\int\_{\bar{\gamma}-\mathrm{i}0}^{\bar{\gamma}+\mathrm{i}\infty}\Re\left(\frac{e^{uz}\mathcal{L}\_{X}(z)}{z}\right)dz, |  |

with γ¯>0\bar{\gamma}>0 and the integral computed using a quadratic integration algorithm. Since the function u↦FX​(u)u\mapsto F\_{X}(u) is monotonic, the value of x∗x\_{\*} such that F¯X​(x∗)=1−FX​(x∗)=𝔼​[𝟏{X>x∗}]=α\bar{F}\_{X}(x\_{\*})=1-F\_{X}(x\_{\*})=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}\_{\{X>x\_{\*}\}}]=\alpha is found iteratively.

We use the following variables to illustrate our approach. First, we consider x11,t=tr​[θ​xt]x\_{11,t}=\mathrm{tr}[\theta x\_{t}] with θ=e11\theta=e\_{11}, and since θ∈𝕊2+\theta\in\mathbb{S}\_{2}^{+} we use the Laplace/inverse Laplace transforms above to find the truncating value for the distribution of x11,tx\_{11,t}. We take x∗=1.0x\_{\*}=1.0 and for which 𝔼​[𝟏{x11,t>x∗}]=0.0910\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}\_{\{x\_{11,t}>x\_{\*}\}}]=0.0910 when t=1t=1 and the parameters of Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.").

As we are interested in a portfolio of losses, we consider st=x11,t+x22,t=tr​[θ​xt]s\_{t}=x\_{11,t}+x\_{22,t}=\mathrm{tr}[\theta x\_{t}] with θ=I2∈𝕊2++\theta=I\_{2}\in\mathbb{S}\_{2}^{++}, so that sts\_{t} is a positive random variable with a distribution that we truncate at the level s∗=1.3s\_{\*}=1.3 for which 𝔼​[𝟏{st>s∗}]=0.0584\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}\_{\{s\_{t}>s\_{\*}\}}]=0.0584 when t=1t=1 and the parameters of Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). This value is also obtained using the Laplace/inverse Laplace transforms above.

Lastly, the equation ([47](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E47 "In 4.1 Implementation details ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) implies that the dependence between x11,tx\_{11,t} and x22,tx\_{22,t} is stochastic and its distribution is given by x12,tx\_{12,t} and it can be used to perform the conditioning of a risk measure. Writing x12,t=tr​[θ​xt]x\_{12,t}=\mathrm{tr}[\theta x\_{t}] with θ=e12/2+e21/2\theta=e\_{12}/2+e\_{21}/2 and choosing x12,∗=0.435x\_{12,\*}=0.435, it leads to 𝔼​[𝟏{x12,t>x12,∗}]=0.0544\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}\_{\{x\_{12,t}>x\_{12,\*}\}}]=0.0544 for t=1t=1 and the parameters of Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). Note that as x12,tx\_{12,t} does not need to have a positive distribution, the Laplace/inverse Laplace transform above has to be replaced by a Fourier/inverse Fourier transform but since the procedure is similar, we omit the details.

### 4.2 One date risk measures

In this subsection, we present and analyze various risk measures computed for the model parameters specified in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") and the thresholds specified above. The values are reported in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.").

[ Insert Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

The first four values provide the first two moments of x11,tx\_{11,t} and sts\_{t} conditional on the events x11,t>x∗x\_{11,t}>x\_{\*} and st>s∗s\_{t}>s\_{\*}, respectively. The next four conditional moments, 𝔼​[x11,t​∣st>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[x\_{11,t}\mid s\_{t}>s\_{\*}], 𝔼​[x11,t2​∣st>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[x\_{11,t}^{2}\mid s\_{t}>s\_{\*}], 𝔼​[st​∣x11,t>​x∗]\mathbb{E}[s\_{t}\mid x\_{11,t}>x\_{\*}], and 𝔼​[st2​∣x11,t>​x∗]\mathbb{E}[s\_{t}^{2}\mid x\_{11,t}>x\_{\*}], illustrate the impact of changing the conditioning set. This involves considering the event st>s∗s\_{t}>s\_{\*} when computing the first two moments of x11,tx\_{11,t}, or the event x11,t>x∗x\_{11,t}>x\_{\*} when computing the first two moments of sts\_{t}. The values suggest that changing the conditioning event affects the second moment more than the first moment. Specifically, the first (conditional) moment of x11,tx\_{11,t} changes by 1.83%1.83\%, while its second moment changes by 3.74%. For sts\_{t}, the corresponding changes are −3.07%-3.07\% and −6.12%-6.12\%, respectively. The framework also allows us to use the conditioning event x12,t>x12,∗x\_{12,t}>x\_{12,\*}, capturing the effects of the covariance between the components of xtx\_{t} when computing the first two (or higher) conditional moments of the aggregated losses sts\_{t}. When considering the first two moments of sts\_{t}, conditioning on this event leads to values closer to those obtained when conditioning on st>s∗s\_{t}>s\_{\*} than when conditioning on x11,t>x∗x\_{11,t}>x\_{\*}. The last value, 𝔼​[x11,t​st​∣st>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[x\_{11,t}s\_{t}\mid s\_{t}>s\_{\*}], illustrates the ability to compute conditional cross-moments. Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

### 4.3 Effect of correlation on risk measures

We analyze the effect of changing the dependence between the losses x11,tx\_{11,t} and x22,tx\_{22,t} on different risk measures. As explained earlier, this is achieved by setting the off-diagonal term of σ\sigma to zero. We denote by x~t\tilde{x}\_{t} the zero-dependent equivalent process to xtx\_{t} and compute the different risk measures, keeping x∗x\_{\*} and s∗s\_{\*} unchanged. The results of the tail conditional expectation calculations are reported in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.").

[ Insert Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") here ]

Analyzing the effect on shortfall measures with σ\sigma’s off-diagonals set to zero reveals interesting findings. Conditioning on x11,tx\_{11,t} does not change the risk measure for both the first and second moments relative to the unchanged σ\sigma case, as expected since σ~\tilde{\sigma} satisfies ([49](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E49 "In 4.1 Implementation details ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")). However, analyzing the sum s~t\tilde{s}\_{t} shows a decrease in shortfall compared to the correlated case, with changes of −1.71%-1.71\% and −4.84%-4.84\% for 𝔼​[s~t​∣s~t>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[\tilde{s}\_{t}\mid\tilde{s}\_{t}>s\_{\*}] and 𝔼​[s~t2​∣s~t>​s∗]\mathbb{E}[\tilde{s}\_{t}^{2}\mid\tilde{s}\_{t}>s\_{\*}], respectively. This indicates a narrowing of the tails due to the removal of dependence between the losses. The narrowing also explains the changes observed in 𝔼​[s~t​∣x~11,t>​x∗]\mathbb{E}[\tilde{s}\_{t}\mid\tilde{x}\_{11,t}>x\_{\*}] and 𝔼​[s~t2​∣x~11,t>​x∗]\mathbb{E}[\tilde{s}\_{t}^{2}\mid\tilde{x}\_{11,t}>x\_{\*}], with the values being −5.07%-5.07\% and −13.37%-13.37\%, respectively. Conversely, x11,tx\_{11,t} conditioned on s~t\tilde{s}\_{t} being above s∗s\_{\*} increases relative to the dependent variant due to the lower expected level of s~t\tilde{s}\_{t} caused by the narrower tail. This also explains why the cross-moment x11,t​stx\_{11,t}s\_{t} conditioned on st>s∗s\_{t}>s\_{\*} increases by 1.11%1.11\%. Practically, it is worth noting that higher-order moments are more affected by changes in the dependence structure between the losses. Since the dependence between losses can be difficult to measure, setting its value to zero can significantly alter risk profiles and the distribution of outcomes.

### 4.4 Two dates risk measures

We conduct numerical experiments on two different dates, t1t\_{1} and t0t\_{0} with t0<t1t\_{0}<t\_{1}, to compute the expected shortfall based on Proposition [3.12](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem12 "Proposition 3.12. ‣ 3.3.1 The two dates case ‣ 3.3 Wishart conditional tail risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). This proposition allows us to compute future expected moments conditional on past losses exceeding a certain threshold. For the dates, we take t0=1t\_{0}=1, as in the previous examples, while t1=1.5t\_{1}=1.5. The thresholds are those of the previous examples and are therefore consistent with the distribution of the process at that date. Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") reports the first and second moments of x11,t1x\_{11,t\_{1}} conditional on x11,t0>x∗x\_{11,t\_{0}}>x\_{\*} and similar quantities for st1s\_{t\_{1}} conditioned on st0>s∗s\_{t\_{0}}>s\_{\*}, as well as the difference (in %\%) with the corresponding values of Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). All the differences are negative, a result that is expected since the process reverts to its long-term mean, which is lower than its conditional expectation at earlier times. Note also that higher-order moments are more affected by this mean-reverting behavior. This modeling aspect leverages the time-dependent nature of the process and allows us to develop an intertemporal or time-lagged point of view of risk measures.

To further illustrate this feature, Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") displays the exponential decay of the two-date expected shortfall 𝔼​[x11,t1​∣x11,t0>​x∗]\mathbb{E}[x\_{11,t\_{1}}\mid x\_{11,t\_{0}}>x\_{\*}] over the range t1∈[1,200]t\_{1}\in[1,200] to its long-term mean value of 0.840.84, with substantial decay occurring only around t=200t=200 and that is controlled by the matrix mm, in particular m11m\_{11}. This mean-reverting behavior can also be combined with a different conditioning, and to this end, the table also reports the first and second moments of x11,t1x\_{11,t\_{1}} conditioned on st0>s∗s\_{t\_{0}}>s\_{\*} and similar quantities for st1s\_{t\_{1}} conditioned on x11,t0>x∗x\_{11,t\_{0}}>x\_{\*}, as well as the difference (in %\%) with the corresponding values of Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). All the conditional expectations are smaller than their counterparts, and of course, the mean-reverting behavior is the reason for such a result.

### 4.5 Effect of dependency in capital allocation

Another use of the conditional higher moments is to solve the capital allocation problem based on the tail mean-variance model defined in Xu and Mao ([2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib29 "Optimal capital allocation based on the tail mean–variance model")). The problem involves optimally allocating capital between losses to minimize the mean-variance of the sum of the square of the losses, conditioned on a certain level of portfolio risk. Mathematically, Theorem 2.1 of Xu and Mao ([2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib29 "Optimal capital allocation based on the tail mean–variance model")) provides an explicit solution for a random vector of losses (Y1,…,Yn)(Y\_{1},\ldots,Y\_{n}) to the allocation problem below:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | min𝐩∈A⁡{𝔼​[∑i=1n(Yi−pi)2​∣Z>​z∗]+γ​Var​(∑i=1n(Yi−pi)2​∣Z>​z∗)},\displaystyle\min\_{\mathbf{p}\in A}\left\{\mathbb{E}\left[\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(Y\_{i}-p\_{i})^{2}\mid Z>z\_{\*}\right]+\gamma\text{Var}\left(\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(Y\_{i}-p\_{i})^{2}\mid Z>z\_{\*}\right)\right\}, |  | (50) |

where A={𝐩∈ℝn:p1+…+pn=c}A=\{\mathbf{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:p\_{1}+\ldots+p\_{n}=c\} with the allocation budget c>0c>0, γ>0\gamma>0, and ZZ is the conditioning variable and z∗z\_{\*} a given threshold. The above conditional expectations can be reformulated in our framework using Remark [3.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem6 "Remark 3.6. ‣ 3.2 One-dimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). Xu and Mao ([2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib29 "Optimal capital allocation based on the tail mean–variance model")) illustrate their results using the multivariate elliptical distribution. Li and Yin ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib28 "The tail mean–variance optimal capital allocation under the extended skew-elliptical distribution")) analyze the same model using the skew-elliptical distribution but underline the difficulty of the problem. Indeed, they state, “… the computational challenge arises due to the calculation involving conditional joint moments of underlying risks” (see Li and Yin ([2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib28 "The tail mean–variance optimal capital allocation under the extended skew-elliptical distribution"), p. 2)). Yang et al. ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib27 "Tail moments and tail joint moments for multivariate generalized hyperbolic distribution")) solve the same problem for the multivariate generalized hyperbolic distribution. One of the difficulties with this model is that it necessitates the computation of 𝔼​[Yj2​Yi​|Z>​z∗]\mathbb{E}[Y\_{j}^{2}Y\_{i}|Z>z\_{\*}] and 𝔼​[Yj​Yi​|Z>​z∗]\mathbb{E}[Y\_{j}Y\_{i}|Z>z\_{\*}] for j,i=1,…,nj,i=1,\ldots,n. Thanks to the strong analytical properties of our results, this difficulty is easily handled in our framework. Note that 𝔼​[Yj​Yi​|Z>​z∗]\mathbb{E}[Y\_{j}Y\_{i}|Z>z\_{\*}] is the first term of TCovY1,Y2|Z⁡(z∗)\operatorname{TCov}\_{Y\_{1},Y\_{2}|Z}(z\_{\*}) of ([42](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E42 "In The Tail covariance (TCov): ‣ 3.5 Conditional higher moments tail risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."))  while 𝔼​[Yj2​Yi​|Z>​z∗]\mathbb{E}[Y\_{j}^{2}Y\_{i}|Z>z\_{\*}] is a third-order conditional moment.

Note that the original result of Xu and Mao ([2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib29 "Optimal capital allocation based on the tail mean–variance model")) is based on conditioning on the sum of the random variables YiY\_{i} (i.e., setting ZZ to be S=∑i=1nYiS=\sum\_{i=1}^{n}Y\_{i} with S>VaRq​(S)S>\text{VaR}\_{q}(S), the conditioning of the sum on the value-at-risk). However, the proof of their result does not require this specific condition, and thus we can choose ZZ to be another variable or combination of variables. Since this problem heavily relies on the dependence between the losses, the conditioning is performed on the variable x12,tx\_{12,t}, thereby quantifying the impact of loss dependence on the capital allocation. It exploits the matrix nature of the Wishart process for modeling risk measures. It will demonstrate the importance of appropriately accounting for dependency in risk management within the Wishart process. To this end, we proceed as above, solving the problem using the parameters of Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") and then considering the process x~t\tilde{x}\_{t}, the zero-dependent equivalent process to xtx\_{t}, and solving the problem ([50](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E50 "In 4.5 Effect of dependency in capital allocation ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")). A comparison between the two solutions illustrates the impact of the losses’ dependence on the capital allocation.

First, we consider the capital allocation problem with Wishart parameters in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."), time value of t=1t=1, the allocation budget c=1.3c=1.3, γ=1\gamma=1, and set the conditioning random variable to be x12,t>VaR0.95​(tr​[θ​xt])x\_{12,t}>\text{VaR}\_{0.95}(\text{tr}[\theta x\_{t}]), where θ=(e12+e21)/2\theta=(e\_{12}+e\_{21})/2. Note that the values of VaR0.95​(tr​[θ​xt])\text{VaR}\_{0.95}(\text{tr}[\theta x\_{t}]) and VaR0.95​(tr​[θ​x~t])\text{VaR}\_{0.95}(\text{tr}[\theta\tilde{x}\_{t}]) are different to account for the difference in the quadratic variations between x11,tx\_{11,t} and x22,tx\_{22,t} and between x~11,t\tilde{x}\_{11,t} and x~22,t\tilde{x}\_{22,t}. In particular, for the dependent case, we have VaR0.95​(tr​[θ​xt])=0.438\text{VaR}\_{0.95}(\text{tr}[\theta x\_{t}])=0.438, while in the diagonal case σ~\tilde{\sigma} given by ([48](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E48 "In 4.1 Implementation details ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) we have VaR0.95​(tr​[θ​x~t])=0.085\text{VaR}\_{0.95}(\text{tr}[\theta\tilde{x}\_{t}])=0.085.

The optimal allocation values for ([50](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S4.E50 "In 4.5 Effect of dependency in capital allocation ‣ 4 Numerical experiments ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) for the case in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") are p1=1.031p\_{1}=1.031 and p2=0.269p\_{2}=0.269, which gives a ratio of p1/p2=3.836p\_{1}/p\_{2}=3.836. In comparison, when using x~t\tilde{x}\_{t}, the optimal allocation is p~1=0.965\tilde{p}\_{1}=0.965 and p~2=0.335\tilde{p}\_{2}=0.335, with a ratio of p~1/p~2=2.877\tilde{p}\_{1}/\tilde{p}\_{2}=2.877. The difference in the allocations is best viewed through their ratios, and the impact of the dependence on this ratio is substantial. Having a dependency between the losses suggests allocating more to the loss with more variance (in this case, x11,tx\_{11,t}). Thus, an erroneous assumption of independence or a significant error in its estimation can lead to a situation where one loss is under-capitalized and another over-capitalized.

As previously demonstrated, the Wishart process is highly tractable and is a natural framework to model dependent losses since it is, by construction, a positive definite matrix process. Furthermore, due to its tractability, we are even able to derive allocation results, and the results highlight that if dependence is not appropriately accounted for, it can lead to incorrect allocation of resources.

### 4.6 Empirical estimation

Practical applicability is an important criterion when evaluating the usefulness of a model. We illustrate our approach using the Danish Fire Loss dataset, a standard benchmark in insurance. The raw data contain 2,167 fire insurance claims from 1980 to 1990, measured in millions of DKK.999Note that we do not apply a logarithmic transformation, as in Ignatieva and Landsman ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib43 "A class of generalised hyper-elliptical distributions and their applications in computing conditional tail risk measures")). We focus on the *Building* and *Contents* lines, excluding *Profit* due to the many zeros, and we aggregate claim amounts to weekly totals, retaining weeks with strictly positive totals in both lines. Throughout, we treat these weekly bivariate observations as i.i.d. draws rather than a time series. As a result, for the model we estimate the parameters of its limiting, stationary distribution. By Corollary [2.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.Thmtheorem2 "Corollary 2.2. ‣ 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."), this distribution is matrix gamma with scale 2​ς∞2\varsigma\_{\infty} and shape β/2\beta/2. The pair (β,ς∞)(\beta,\varsigma\_{\infty}) is obtained by the method of moments, as in Gouriéroux et al. ([2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib32 "The Wishart autoregressive process of multivariate stochastic volatility")) or Gouriéroux and Lu ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib2 "Partial observability of implied volatility matrices: Identification and covolatilities filtering"), Proposition 2), and the explicit equations are given in the supplementary appendix. In other words, we fit the stationary law to the weekly aggregates, then compute the risk measures developed in this paper from the fitted law.

If only the diagonal terms of the process are used to estimate the parameters, then only ςi​j,∞2\varsigma\_{ij,\infty}^{2} can be identified; see the supplementary appendix for the expressions of the estimators. Since we have 𝔼​[xi​j,∞]=β​ςi​j,∞\mathbb{E}[x\_{ij,\infty}]=\beta\varsigma\_{ij,\infty}, this suggests specifying the sign of ςi​j,∞\varsigma\_{ij,\infty} using the sign of the correlation between xi​i,∞x\_{ii,\infty} and xj​j,∞x\_{jj,\infty}. These estimators yield the model parameters reported in Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.").

We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.") here ]

The implied correlation from the fitted matrix gamma distribution is 0.44, and is close to the sample correlation of 0.56 from the weekly aggregates, which indicates a reasonable fit. Using Proposition [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem1 "Proposition 3.1. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."), we compute the model implied risk measures, see Table [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.T6 "Table 6 ‣ Tables ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."). For reference, we also report the empirical, nonparametric counterparts computed directly from the weekly data. The model implied quantities track their empirical analogues closely, which supports the adequacy of the limiting distribution specification for this application.

## 5 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce an analytical framework capable of quantifying multivariate risk measures while incorporating temporal aspects. The flexibility of the framework lies in its reliance solely on the characteristic function. We present Fourier transforms of tail conditional moments and their cross-moments, and show that this approach reduces a two-dimensional integration problem to a one-dimensional one. We compute the tail conditional expectation for various cross-moments, both at a single point in time and across multiple time points. This flexible framework is demonstrated using the Wishart process—a highly tractable matrix affine process characterized by its positive definiteness—making it well-suited for loss modeling. We provide a numerical implementation of the derived framework and demonstrate the impact of dependency between loss items. Our results show that removing dependency can lead to significant differences in the tail conditional expectation, with variations of up to 13.37% at a fixed point in time and up to 18.86% across time. We further demonstrate that our method and model can be applied in the context of capital allocation, showcasing that we are able to obtain operational results for the model proposed by Xu and Mao ([2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib29 "Optimal capital allocation based on the tail mean–variance model")). Overall, our framework offers a robust and flexible tool for risk management, capable of handling complex dependencies and temporal evolutions in multivariate loss processes.

##### A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")) and Ignatieva and Landsman ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib44 "Tail variance for generalised hyper-elliptical models")):

We provide complete details, using the methodology presented in this paper, on the implementation of the expected shortfall, the tail variance and the tail skewness for a univariate random variable following a Generalised Hyperbolic (GH) distribution. For the expected shortfall, it is given by ([36](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E36 "In 3.4 A note on numerical precision ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) and corresponds to Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family"), Eq. (3.4)). As in Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")), we derive the expression for the characteristic function of the univariate GH distribution from the moment generating function ([35](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E35 "In 3.4 A note on numerical precision ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")), and it corresponds to Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family"), Eq. (2.6)), where we correct for a missing square root in the modified Bessel function of the third kind that appears in the denominator. Following Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")), see Paolella ([2007](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib38 "Intermediate probability: a computational approach")) for further details.

Given a scalar variable Y∼G​H1​(λ,χ,ψ,μ,σ2,γ)Y\sim GH\_{1}(\lambda,\chi,\psi,\mu,\sigma^{2},\gamma) with λ,χ,ψ,μ,σ2,γ\lambda,\chi,\psi,\mu,\sigma^{2},\gamma scalar values and χ>0\chi>0 and ψ>0\psi>0, the univariate GH distribution with density ([38](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E38 "In 3.4 A note on numerical precision ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")). Then the moment generating function of YY, given by ([35](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E35 "In 3.4 A note on numerical precision ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

The tail conditional expectation TCEY⁡(y∗)\operatorname{TCE}\_{Y}(y\_{\*}) is equal to ([19](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E19 "In 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

and according to Proposition [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.Thmtheorem1 "Proposition 3.1. ‣ 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

It remains to check the integrability of these functions. The second integrand in ([53](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.E53 "In A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman (2019) and Ignatieva and Landsman (2025): ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

with c>0c>0 and as |ΦY​(α1−i​u1)|≤|𝔼​[e(α1−i​u1)​Y]|≤|𝔼​[eα1​Y]||\Phi\_{Y}(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})|\leq|\mathbb{E}[e^{(\alpha\_{1}-\mathrm{i}u\_{1})Y}]|\leq|\mathbb{E}[e^{\alpha\_{1}Y}]| is finite for α1\alpha\_{1} sufficiently small since ψ>0\psi>0, we conclude the integral is well defined. Note that α1\alpha\_{1} can have any sign. The integral ([54](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.E54 "In A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman (2019) and Ignatieva and Landsman (2025): ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

with c>0c>0 (a generic constant that may change from one equation to the other), and using DLMF ([2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib45 "Digital library of mathematical functions"), (10.25.3)) we have for u1u\_{1} large (and positive)

with c>0c>0. For u1u\_{1} large we get, since χ>0\chi>0, that there exists c>0c>0 such that

and this upper bound combined with ([56](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.E56 "In A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman (2019) and Ignatieva and Landsman (2025): ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

As result, ([53](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.E53 "In A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman (2019) and Ignatieva and Landsman (2025): ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks.

The integral above can be decomposed as a sum of three integrals, the first two being well defined according to the verifications already done, and the last one is also well defined. As a result, the tail variance risk representation based on the MGF is well defined.

###### Remark .1.

Note that there is a typo in Ignatieva and Landsman ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib44 "Tail variance for generalised hyper-elliptical models"), Eq. (3.6)). In the second line of this equation, the term F¯GH1​(xq;μ,σ2,g,γ,l,λ~2,χ,ψ)\bar{F}\_{\mathrm{GH}\_{1}}(x\_{q};\mu,\sigma^{2},g,\gamma,l,\tilde{\lambda}\_{2},\chi,\psi) should be replaced by F¯GH1​(xq;μ,σ2,g,γ,l,λ~4,χ,ψ)\bar{F}\_{\mathrm{GH}\_{1}}(x\_{q};\mu,\sigma^{2},g,\gamma,l,\tilde{\lambda}\_{4},\chi,\psi) (in the notations of Ignatieva and Landsman ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib44 "Tail variance for generalised hyper-elliptical models"))).

Of course, ([60](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.E60 "In A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman (2019) and Ignatieva and Landsman (2025): ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) computed using the MGF and ([61](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.E61 "In A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman (2019) and Ignatieva and Landsman (2025): ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) should yield the same numerical results.

Lastly, for the tail skewness, when p=3p=3 in ([19](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E19 "In 3.1 Multidimensional Fourier transform representations for risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")), the simplicity of the method proposed in our work allows us to compute

with the first integral above being well-defined, since ([59](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.E59 "In A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman (2019) and Ignatieva and Landsman (2025): ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) is, while the last integral is also well-defined. Combining this expectation with the tail conditional variance ([60](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#Ax1.E60 "In A comparison with Ignatieva and Landsman (2019) and Ignatieva and Landsman (2025): ‣ Figures ‣ Tables and figures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) and the expression ([43](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S3.E43 "In The Tail skewness (TS): ‣ 3.5 Conditional higher moments tail risk measures ‣ 3 Conditional tail risk measures ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")) gives us the tail skewness, which is yet to be computed in the case of Ignatieva and Landsman ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib44 "Tail variance for generalised hyper-elliptical models")).

Let us verify that the tail conditional expectation and tail variance values obtained using the approach based on the MGF match those reported by Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family")) and Ignatieva and Landsman ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib44 "Tail variance for generalised hyper-elliptical models")). For the tail skewness, we provide its value, which could be used to validate a formula based on the density once such a formula becomes available.

We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies.")), and relies on the moment generating function. The parameters are those for the aggregate portfolio Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family"), Table 1, Panel F) while q=0.95q=0.95 and y∗y\_{\*} is the qq level quantile.

###### Remark .2.

Note that our value for TCE\operatorname{TCE} does not correspond to the reported value (i.e., 2.2196152.219615) in Ignatieva and Landsman ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib42 "Conditional tail risk measures for the skewed generalised hyperbolic family"), Table 4, Panel F, column GH), which implies that there is an implementation error in that paper.

##### A simple implementation of the method of moments estimator:

This part records the method of moments formulas used to estimate (ς∞,β)(\varsigma\_{\infty},\,\beta) in Corollary [2.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#S2.Thmtheorem2 "Corollary 2.2. ‣ 2 The mathematical framework ‣ Wishart conditional tail risk measures: An analytic approach1footnote 11footnote 1We thank Katja Ignatieva for her useful suggestions and remarks. We also thank the participants at CICIRM 2024, Ningbo, China and IME 2024, Chicago, USA, for their remarks. The usual caveat applies."), the parameters of the limiting distribution of xtx\_{t} in the Bru ([1991](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib85 "Wishart processes")) case (i.e., when ω=β​σ2\omega=\beta\sigma^{2}). See Gouriéroux et al. ([2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib32 "The Wishart autoregressive process of multivariate stochastic volatility"), Section 5) and Gouriéroux and Lu ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib2 "Partial observability of implied volatility matrices: Identification and covolatilities filtering"), Prop. 2 and Prop. 5) for derivations.

At the population level (with i≠ji\neq j), the identities are

|  | β\displaystyle\beta | =2​(𝔼​[xi​i,∞])2Var⁡[xi​i,∞],\displaystyle=\frac{2\,\big(\mathbb{E}[x\_{ii,\infty}]\big)^{2}}{\operatorname{Var}[x\_{ii,\infty}]}, |  | (63) |

where β\beta does not depend on the index ii. As result, there are several estimator for β\beta and for ςi​j,∞2\varsigma\_{ij,\infty}^{2}.

Gouriéroux and Lu ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib2 "Partial observability of implied volatility matrices: Identification and covolatilities filtering")) suggest the following estimation procedure. Let μ^i\widehat{\mu}\_{i}, ηi2^\widehat{\eta\_{i}^{2}}, and γ^i​j\widehat{\gamma}\_{ij} denote the sample mean of xi​i,tx\_{ii,t}, the sample variance of xi​i,tx\_{ii,t}, and the sample covariance of (xi​i,t,xj​j,t)(x\_{ii,t},x\_{jj,t}), respectively. The plug-in estimators are

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | β^=2n​∑i=1n(μ^i)2ηi2^,ςi​i,∞^=ηi2^2​μ^i,ςi​i,∞2^=γ^i​j2​β^.\widehat{\beta}=\frac{2}{n}\sum\_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(\widehat{\mu}\_{i})^{2}}{\widehat{\eta\_{i}^{2}}},\qquad\widehat{\varsigma\_{ii,\infty}}=\frac{\widehat{\eta\_{i}^{2}}}{2\,\widehat{\mu}\_{i}},\qquad\widehat{\varsigma\_{ii,\infty}^{2}}=\frac{\widehat{\gamma}\_{ij}}{2\widehat{\beta}}. |  | (66) |

Note that we also have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 𝔼​[xi​j,∞]=β​ςi​j,∞.\displaystyle\mathbb{E}[x\_{ij,\infty}]=\beta\varsigma\_{ij,\infty}. |  | (67) |

###### Remark .3.

Relative to Gouriéroux and Lu ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib2 "Partial observability of implied volatility matrices: Identification and covolatilities filtering")), there is a missing factor of 22 in the formulas for β\beta, ςi​i,∞\varsigma\_{ii,\infty} and ςi​j,∞\varsigma\_{ij,\infty}. Further to this, the ςi​j,∞\varsigma\_{ij,\infty} in Gouriéroux and Lu ([2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.06401v1#bib.bib2 "Partial observability of implied volatility matrices: Identification and covolatilities filtering"), Eq. (7)) is off by a factor of β\beta.
