###### Abstract

This paper provides quasi-experimental evidence on how income taxes affect gross hourly wages, utilizing Danish administrative data and a tax reform that introduced joint taxation. Exploiting spousal income for identification, we present nonparametric, difference-in-differences graphical evidence among husbands. For low-income workers, taxes have negative and dynamic effects on wages; their wage elasticity with respect to net-of-marginal-tax rates is 0.4. For medium-income workers, the effects are smaller and insignificant. Wages respond to taxes through promotions or job-to-job transitions. Neither daily nor annual hours worked respond significantly; consequently, annual earnings respond to taxes primarily through hourly wages, rather than through labor supply.

## 1 Introduction

Economists have long studied the distortionary and distributional effects of income taxes on labor market outcomes. While most empirical studies have focused on labor supply responses, there is limited evidence on how taxes affect gross hourly wages—another key component of earnings. Moreover, wages may respond to taxes through various channels. For example, some economists predict that higher tax rates have negative and dynamic effects on wages by reducing incentives to accumulate human capital or search for higher-paying jobs—two main drivers of wage growth (Rubinstein and Weiss, [2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib44)). Therefore, to better understand the policy implications, it is crucial to empirically identify both the effects of taxes on wages and the channels through which wages respond to taxes.

Given these motivations, this paper asks the following research questions: Do income taxes have positive or negative effects on gross hourly wages? Are these effects static or dynamic? Through what channels do wages respond to taxes? How do wage responses compare with the responses of annual earnings and labor supply?

To answer these questions compellingly, we provide quasi-experimental evidence utilizing Danish administrative data and a tax reform that came into effect in 1987. First, our dataset is a population-wide annual panel containing extensive information on individual income and worker/job characteristics. We select a sample of working married males. Next, we use the 1987 tax reform for our empirical strategy because it introduced joint taxation to a middle tax bracket, bringing large changes to the tax system faced by married couples. This unique institutional change allows us to exploit variation in spousal income and thus identify the following two groups located in a bottom tax bracket before the reform: one group with higher spousal income is pushed upward to the middle bracket by the reform, whereas the other group with lower spousal income remains in the bottom bracket due to joint taxation. We then compare the outcome dynamics of these two groups in a difference-in-differences (DID) design. Although Gruber et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib15)) and Kleven and Schultz ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)) also use this reform as a natural experiment, our approach is novel in its focus on the introduction of joint taxation.

We present clear nonparametric graphical evidence and regression results regarding the effects of taxes on various outcomes (see, for example, Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") lists the main elasticity estimates with respect to net-of-marginal-tax rates, along with related results. Our findings are as follows.

First, taxes have heterogeneous effects on wages across income levels. Low-income workers respond to taxes negatively and dynamically. Higher marginal tax rates gradually depress wage growth over time; that is, distortion dynamically accumulates on wages, which we refer to as accumulating effects in this paper. Their elasticity of wages with respect to net-of-marginal-tax rates is 0.4. Their elasticity is relatively large because our DID design captures the dynamic and accumulating effects, rather than short-run effects attenuated by optimization frictions. Specifically, workers gradually change their behavior in response to taxes while overcoming optimization frictions. These gradual responses lead to the accumulating effects, which are reflected in their relatively large elasticity. By contrast, for medium-income workers, the effects of taxes on wages are smaller and statistically insignificant. Given the relatively large elasticity and novel accumulating effects, we move on to the details of low-income workers.

Second, we find that wages respond to taxes through promotions or job-to-job transitions. Workers facing higher marginal tax rates are less likely to be promoted to skilled or white-collar positions, arguably due to reduced incentives to accumulate human capital or work harder. Similarly, workers facing higher marginal tax rates are less likely to make job-to-job transitions, arguably due to reduced incentives to search for higher-paying jobs. These two dynamic channels can explain the negative and accumulating effects of taxes on wages. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first quasi-experimental evidence on these channels.

Third, we find that labor supply responses along the intensive margin, as measured by daily or annual hours worked, are statistically insignificant and smaller in magnitude than the wage responses. Consequently, the elasticity of annual earnings (estimated at 0.5) is primarily driven by that of hourly wages (estimated at 0.4), rather than by that of annual hours worked (estimated at 0.1 and insignificant).

Finally, the estimation results survive the following threats to identification: First, since spousal income serves as an instrumental variable in our DID design, we verify its exclusion restriction, which requires that spousal income affects outcome dynamics only through the treatment (i.e., tax rates). Specifically, in addition to confirming parallel pre-reform outcome dynamics, we conduct a placebo test and show parallel pre- and post-reform outcome dynamics between two placebo groups that differ exclusively in spousal income but face nearly identical tax rates (i.e., the absence of the treatment). Second, this placebo test also provides evidence that the introduction of joint taxation does not affect outcome dynamics through income reallocation between spouses, thereby validating our interpretation of wage responses as reflecting the effects of marginal tax rates. Third, although workers may become non-employed with missing wages, we show that the compositional changes of employed workers do not create the spurious negative effects of taxes on wages. Fourth, we confirm that individuals do not bunch at a tax bracket cutoff; otherwise, such bunching might bias estimates. Fifth, the estimation results are robust to modest changes to the definition of low-income workers.

This paper broadly contributes to the literature on public and labor economics. First, we offer novel implications for how taxes affect various labor market outcomes. Although Blomquist and Selin ([2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib6)) and Martínez et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib39)) also provide credible quasi-experimental evidence on negative wage responses, we found heterogeneous responses across income levels. Our findings on larger wage responses among low-income workers contrast with existing findings on larger taxable income responses among high-income earners (Saez et al., [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib46)), which has implications for progressive tax policies, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States. Furthermore, we found that wage responses occur through promotions or job-to-job transitions and are larger than labor supply responses, consequently accounting for most of annual earning responses—a series of new insights in the literature.

Second, this paper fills the gap between the micro and macro literature by estimating the accumulating effects. Broadly speaking, to study how income taxes affect labor market outcomes (e.g., wages), the micro literature estimates short-run elasticities using quasi-experimental methods, primarily DID designs (Saez et al., [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib46)). By contrast, the macro literature estimates long-run (steady-state) elasticities by calibrating dynamic models, such as learning-by-doing models (Keane and Rogerson, [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib25), [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib26)), Ben-Porath models (Heckman et al., [1998](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib17), [1999](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib18)), or job search models (Kreiner et al., [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib33); Shephard, [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib47)). Often, the micro literature reports smaller elasticities than the macro literature. We shed new light on this discrepancy as follows: By estimating the accumulating effects over a post-reform period of seven years in a credible DID design, we address optimization frictions that attenuate short-run elasticities estimated in the micro DID literature. As a result, we uncover structural elasticities that are conceptually akin to long-run elasticities estimated in the macro calibration literature (Chetty, [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib8); Chetty et al., [2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib9); Kleven and Waseem, [2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib29); Kleven et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib32)). Therefore, the accumulating effects bridge these short- and long-run elasticities.

Finally, this paper provides motivations for welfare analysis and optimal taxation. Our findings lend empirical support to recent research on optimal policies with human capital accumulation or career effects (Stantcheva, [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib49)), or job search (Chetty, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib7); Kroft et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib34)). Moreover, since we found larger wage responses than labor supply responses, it will be fruitful to extend optimal tax formulae based on the canonical labor supply model (Piketty and Saez, [2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib42)) by incorporating wage responses through alternative channels such as wage bargaining (Piketty et al., [2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib43)) or employer learning (Craig, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib10)).

## 2 The Danish income tax system and the 1987 tax reform

This section describes the Danish income tax system and the 1987 tax reform, focusing on their relevance to our empirical strategy. The key features of the tax system are a progressive structure with three tax brackets, and individual tax filing for married couples. The reform introduced joint taxation to a middle tax bracket, bringing large changes to the tax system faced by married couples.

### 2.1 Income concepts

In Denmark, income taxes are levied at the source with individual tax filing and are primarily based on three income concepts: labor income (LI), capital income (CI), and itemized deductions (D). For ease of exposition, we omit two income concepts of minor importance for our sample: personal income and stock income. These omitted income concepts are explained later in Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A2 "Appendix B Overview of the tax simulator ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."). However, we emphasize that we fully consider all income concepts when simulating tax liabilities for the empirical analysis in Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3 "3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Labor income is the main source of income for most individuals in our sample. Furthermore, their capital income is often negative due to interest payments on debt, such as mortgage loans.111Our description of the institutional settings relies on Kleven and Schultz ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)), the Danish Ministry of Finance (<https://fm.dk>), and the Danish Ministry of Taxation (<https://www.skm.dk>).

### 2.2 The pre-reform tax system

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") outlines the key features of the Danish income tax system in the final pre-reform year, 1986. Danish income taxes are divided into regional and national taxes. Regional taxes were levied on taxable income LI+CI−D\text{LI}+\text{CI}-\text{D} exceeding the cutoff of DKK 20,700 (DKK 1 in 1986 == USD 0.3 in 2022). The regional tax rate is a flat rate that slightly varies across municipalities and counties; in 1986, the average regional tax rate was 28.0 percent, and the 90–10 percentile range was 3.7 percentage points.222For our sample period, 1981–1993, the administrative structure of Denmark comprised 275 municipalities (“kommuner”) and 14 counties (“amter”, a county that spans a set of municipalities). Both municipalities and counties levy income taxes on their residents. The regional tax rate is the sum of the municipal, county, and Church tax rates. The Church taxes are minuscule and are paid only by members of the Church of Denmark (“Folkekirken”).

National taxes have a progressive structure with three tax brackets: bottom, middle, and top brackets. The tax base for each bracket was LI+CI−D\text{LI}+\text{CI}-\text{D}, taxed with different cutoffs at different rates. These national taxes are cumulative, making the tax system progressive: taxable income LI+CI−D\text{LI}+\text{CI}-\text{D} exceeding the bottom bracket cutoff of DKK 23,200 was taxed at the bottom tax rate of 19.9 percent; LI+CI−D\text{LI}+\text{CI}-\text{D} exceeding DKK 113,400 was taxed at the middle tax rate of 14.4 percent; and LI+CI−D\text{LI}+\text{CI}-\text{D} exceeding DKK 186,100 was taxed at the top tax rate of 10.8 percent. Combined with the average regional tax rate of 28.0 percent, the marginal tax rates in 1986 were thus 47.9 percent in the bottom bracket, 62.3 percent in the middle bracket, and 73.1 percent in the top bracket. However, the top tax rate was adjusted downward to a marginal tax ceiling of 73.0 percent.

Crucially for our empirical strategy, taxation is based on individual tax filing for married couples. Married individuals file taxes individually and separately, with both spouses receiving equal tax treatment. Before the reform, even if married individuals were not liable for certain taxes, such as the middle taxes, and had unused allowances (calculated as the bracket cutoff DKK 113,400 minus their taxable income LI+CI−D\text{LI}+\text{CI}-\text{D}), these unused allowances could not be transferred to their spouses. This point is highlighted in the left panel of Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

### 2.3 The 1987 tax reform

The reform was legislated on March 18, 1986, and came into immediate and full effect on January 1, 1987. We describe the background of the reform in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A1 "Appendix A Background of the 1987 tax reform ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") outlines the key features of the Danish income tax system in 1987. There were only minor changes in regional taxes. In national taxes, there were three major changes. First, the bottom and top tax rates were increased, whereas the middle tax rate was decreased; as a result, combined with the average regional tax rate of 29.0 percent, the marginal tax rates in 1987 were 51.0 percent in the bottom bracket, 57.0 percent in the middle bracket, and 69.0 percent in the top bracket.

Second, the tax base for the middle bracket was changed to labor income plus positive capital income (LI+[CI>0]\text{LI}+[\text{CI}>0]), and the tax base for the top bracket was changed to labor income plus capital income exceeding DKK 60,000 (LI+[CI>60​k]\text{LI}+[\text{CI}>60\text{k}]). In addition, the three bracket cutoffs were all increased by more than a statutory inflation adjustment of 2.0 percent. As a result, some individuals were mechanically pushed to other brackets.

Finally and most crucially for our empirical strategy, the reform introduced joint taxation to the middle bracket. If married individuals are not liable for the middle taxes and have unused allowances (calculated as the bracket cutoff DKK 130,000 minus their taxable income LI+[CI>0]\text{LI}+[\text{CI}>0]), these unused allowances can be transferred to their spouses. To elaborate on this institutional change, consider the following example: suppose, in 1987, a husband (our sample) has taxable income for the middle bracket equal to DKK 150,000 (i.e., LI+[CI>0]=150,000\text{LI}+[\text{CI}>0]=150,000), and his wife has taxable income equal to DKK 100,000 (i.e., LIw+[CIw>0]=100,000\text{LI}^{\text{w}}+[\text{CI}^{\text{w}}>0]=100,000, with the superscript w denoting “wife”). If the joint taxation is not in place (like in the pre-reform tax system), he is liable for the middle taxes given the bracket cutoff of DKK 130,000, but she is not. Note that she has unused allowances equal to 130,000−100,000=30,000130,000-100,000=30,000. Under the post-reform tax system, her unused allowances can be transferred to him; therefore, his taxable income is re-calculated as 150,000−30,000=120,000150,000-30,000=120,000. Then, he is no longer liable for the middle taxes. Despite this transfer scheme, married individuals continue to file taxes individually and separately; admittedly, using the words “joint taxation” might be a slight abuse of terminology.

We utilize this institutional change as a novel natural experiment. Specifically, in the next section, we identify two groups of individuals with similar income patterns (LI, CI, D, CIw\text{CI}^{\text{w}}, Dw\text{D}^{\text{w}}) who were in the bottom bracket before the reform. One group with higher wives’ labor income (LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}}) is mechanically pushed upward to the middle bracket by the reform, whereas the other group with lower wives’ labor income (LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}}) remains in the bottom bracket due to the joint taxation. These bracket movements form the basis for the DID design employed in this paper.

## 3 Empirical strategy

This section explains how we select a sample, define treated and control individuals in our DID design, and address endogeneity caused by the correlation between treatment assignment and pre-reform income. Our empirical strategy leverages the joint taxation introduced to the middle bracket and cross-sectional variation in wives’ labor income (LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}}).

### 3.1 Sample selection

We select a sample period 1981–1993 for two reasons. First, a reliable measure of gross hourly wages is available from 1981 (Lund and Vejlin, [2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib38)). Second, the subsequent tax reform after the one in 1987 occurred in 1994. The year 1986 serves as a baseline pre-reform year for this paper. Although we detail our data in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S4 "4 Danish administrative data ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."), it suffices to mention here that we have access to annual panel data on individual income (LI, CI, D, LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}}, CIw\text{CI}^{\text{w}}, Dw\text{D}^{\text{w}}), demographic characteristics, and outcomes (e.g., wages) for our sample period 1981–1993.

We exclude females from our sample to facilitate identification. First, Chetty et al. ([2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib9)) find that in Denmark, married females tend to bunch at bracket cutoffs. Since our DID design is based on bracket movements, such bunching complicates identification. Second, Kleven et al. ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib30)) find that in Denmark, more than 10 percent of female workers (as opposed to almost zero percent of male workers) exit the labor market after having a child. These labor market exits further complicate the identification of wage responses to taxes among employed workers.

Consequently, we select a sample of prime-age working males whose wives had positive labor income in 1986. Specifically, we select males who, in 1986, were (i) younger than 50 years old and (ii) employed on the 28th of November—our definition of employment (to be explained in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S4 "4 Danish administrative data ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.")). These two restrictions identify males strongly attached to the labor market, facilitating the identification of wage responses to taxes among employed workers. We further impose the following two restrictions on the sample: in 1986, (iii) they were married, and (iv) their wives had (strictly) positive labor income. We impose the third restriction to exploit the joint taxation introduced by the reform. We impose the fourth restriction to make treated and control individuals similar by excluding non-working wives; thus, we exploit cross-sectional variation in labor income earned by working wives, as shown in the following subsections.

Hence, our sample consists of males who satisfy the four restrictions related to the baseline pre-reform year 1986 and are tracked both backward until 1981 and forward until 1993. We have small sample attrition due to reasons such as death or emigration, with a 2.2% attrition rate in 1993. Based on this sample, we define treated and control individuals below.

### 3.2 Treated and control individuals

Since our DID design focuses on movements between the bottom and middle brackets, we first identify the tax brackets in which individuals are located using a tax simulator. The simulator was originally developed by Kleven and Schultz ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)) and Bagger et al. ([2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib4)), and encodes the details of the Danish income tax system for each year. It identifies a bracket location for each individual by taking as its main input his and spousal income (LI, CI, D, LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}}, CIw\text{CI}^{\text{w}}, Dw\text{D}^{\text{w}}); see Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A2 "Appendix B Overview of the tax simulator ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A. Harmon, Bo Honoré, Niels Johannesen, Daiji Kawaguchi, Francis Kramarz, Claus T. Kreiner, Jakob R. Munch, Fabien Postel-Vinay, Andrew Shephard, Oskar N. Skans, Linh T. Tô, Shintaro Yamaguchi, and seminar/conference participants at Aarhus University, CREST, EALE, IIPF, Osaka University, RIETI, Royal Holloway, and ZEW for their comments. Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") for an overview of the simulator. Let B86​(zi​86)\text{B}^{86}(z\_{i86}) denote that individual ii with 1986 income zi​86:={LIi​86,CIi​86,Di​86,LIi​86w,CIi​86w,Di​86w}z\_{i86}:=\{\text{LI}\_{i86},\text{CI}\_{i86},\text{D}\_{i86},\text{LI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86},\text{CI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86},\text{D}^{\text{w}}\_{i86}\} is in the bottom bracket under the 1986 tax system. More precisely, B86​(zi​86)\text{B}^{86}(z\_{i86}) means that he is liable for the bottom taxes but neither the middle nor top taxes.

To define treated and control individuals based on bracket movements, we next consider the following counterfactual bracket location: let B~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{B}}^{87}(z\_{i86}) denote that individual ii with 1986 income zi​86z\_{i86} (rather than 1987 income zi​87z\_{i87}) is in the bottom bracket if hypothetically facing the inflation-adjusted 1987 tax system. We adjust all monetary values related to the 1987 tax system (e.g., bracket cutoffs) to the 1986 price level. Analogously, let M~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{M}}^{87}(z\_{i86}) denote that individual ii with 1986 income zi​86z\_{i86} is in the middle bracket under the inflation-adjusted 1987 tax system. More precisely, M~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{M}}^{87}(z\_{i86}) means that he is liable for both the bottom and middle taxes but not the top taxes. We identify individuals in either B~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{B}}^{87}(z\_{i86}) or M~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{M}}^{87}(z\_{i86}) using the tax simulator.

By combining the actual and counterfactual bracket locations, we define treated and control individuals as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Treated: | B86​(zi​86)andM~87​(zi​86)\displaystyle\ \text{B}^{86}(z\_{i86})\ \ \text{and}\ \ \widetilde{\text{M}}^{87}(z\_{i86}) |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Control: | B86​(zi​86)andB~87​(zi​86).\displaystyle\ \text{B}^{86}(z\_{i86})\ \ \text{and}\ \ \widetilde{\text{B}}^{87}(z\_{i86}). |  | (1) |

The treated individuals were in the bottom bracket in the baseline pre-reform year 1986 but are in the middle bracket under the 1987 tax system. M~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{M}}^{87}(z\_{i86}) is independent of behavioral responses to the reform because their income is fixed at the pre-reform 1986 level; therefore, their movement from the bottom bracket to the middle bracket is mechanically created by the reform. By contrast, the control individuals remain in the bottom bracket in the absence of behavioral responses to the reform, i.e., B~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{B}}^{87}(z\_{i86}). Hence, the treatment is being mechanically pushed upward to the middle bracket, as Saez ([2003](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib45)) similarly exploits bracket creep caused by high inflation.333One might consider another bracket movement that exploits the joint taxation introduced to the middle bracket: treated individuals are pushed downward from the middle bracket to the bottom bracket, whereas control individuals remain in the middle bracket. In this case, however, we found that these individuals were not similar in pre-reform covariates or trends. By contrast, we show in the next subsection that the treated and control individuals defined by the treatment assignment ([3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3.Ex1 "3.2 Treated and control individuals ‣ 3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

### 3.3 Endogeneity caused by pre-reform income

The treatment assignment ([3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3.Ex1 "3.2 Treated and control individuals ‣ 3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.")) correlates with pre-reform income zi​86z\_{i86}, which potentially causes endogeneity: if the treated individuals had significantly higher zi​86z\_{i86} than the control individuals, their outcomes (e.g., wages) would evolve differently even without any treatment. One thus needs to control for zi​86z\_{i86}; however, controlling for every component of zi​86={LIi​86,CIi​86,Di​86,LIi​86w,CIi​86w,Di​86w}z\_{i86}=\{\text{LI}\_{i86},\text{CI}\_{i86},\text{D}\_{i86},\text{LI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86},\text{CI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86},\text{D}^{\text{w}}\_{i86}\} loses variation for identification—a challenge recognized in the literature on the elasticity of taxable income (Saez et al., [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib46)). We show below that nonparametrically controlling for labor income LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} also balances own and spousal capital income and deductions (CIi​86\text{CI}\_{i86}, Di​86\text{D}\_{i86}, CIi​86w\text{CI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86}, Di​86w\text{D}^{\text{w}}\_{i86}); as a result, our empirical strategy leverages variation in wives’ labor income LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} as a source of identification.

The left panel plots the kernel density estimates of LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} by treatment status. The two distributions are similar and sufficiently overlap. The large overlap is thanks to the joint taxation and variation in wives’ income. We elaborate on this point in Appendix [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A3 "Appendix C Distributions of pre-reform labor income among single males ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Returning to married males (our sample) in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."), we plot in the right panel the histogram of LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} with a bin width of DKK 20,000 among the treated and control individuals (on the left axis). We also plot the fractions of the treated individuals within each bin (on the right axis). These fractions can be regarded as propensity scores given LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86}. Two observations are worth highlighting. First, there is limited overlap in the two leftmost bins. Therefore, we discard individuals in these bins—a decision partially informed by a rule of thumb proposed by Crump et al. ([2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib11)) to discard individuals with estimated propensity scores outside the range [0.1,0.9][0.1,0.9]. Second, the propensity scores vary within the domain [120​k,180​k][120\text{k},180\text{k}] with large sample sizes but remain constant within the domain [180​k,280​k][180\text{k},280\text{k}] with small sample sizes.

Based on these observations, we define two income groups as follows: low-income (120,000≤LIi​86<160,000120,000\leq\text{LI}\_{i86}<160,000) and medium-income (160,000≤LIi​86<280,000160,000\leq\text{LI}\_{i86}<280,000) groups. The low-income group has a narrower domain of LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} that limits the impact of the varying propensity scores while still retaining a sufficient sample size. By selecting this narrow domain, we nonparametrically control for LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86}, thus expecting balanced LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} between the treated and control individuals. By contrast, the medium-income group has a wider domain that ensures a sufficient sample size, with the constant propensity scores contributing to balanced LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86}. Therefore, the way we construct these two groups is similar to stratification based on the propensity scores. We analyze each group separately and later check robustness to modest changes to the group definition.

Next, we present summary statistics of pre-reform covariates to assess the similarity between the treated and control individuals. Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") lists the means of covariates in 1986 by treatment status for each income group. Standard deviations are in parentheses. Notice that, by construction, the two income groups have sufficient and roughly identical sample sizes. Following a common practice in the matching literature (Imbens, [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib20); Imbens and Rubin, [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib21); Stuart, [2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib50)), we assess the similarity using a normalized difference (abbreviated as “N. d.” in the table). It is defined as X¯T−X¯C(ST2+SC2)/2\frac{\overline{X}\_{T}-\overline{X}\_{C}}{\sqrt{(S\_{T}^{2}+S\_{C}^{2})/2}} for each covariate, where X¯T\overline{X}\_{T} and X¯C\overline{X}\_{C} are the means among the treated and control individuals respectively, and STS\_{T} and SCS\_{C} are the corresponding standard deviations. Importantly, the normalized difference is independent of sample sizes in expectation, thus offering a key advantage over the tt-statistic for testing the null hypothesis of no differences in population means between the treated and control individuals. As a general guideline, a covariate is considered as balanced between the treated and control individuals if its normalized difference is less than 0.25.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") shows the same patterns for the two income groups. First, by construction, labor income LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} is balanced between the treated and control individuals. Although the normalized difference within the low-income group is relatively large (0.65), the raw difference in mean LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} is modest (DKK 6,000) and only slightly larger than that within the medium-income group (DKK 4,000). Note that DKK 1 in 1986 equals USD 0.3 in 2022. Therefore, we consider LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} as balanced within the low-income group—a conclusion later supported by the insensitivity of estimation results to modest changes to the group definition (120,000≤LIi​86<160,000120,000\leq\text{LI}\_{i86}<160,000).444The narrow domain of LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} for the low-income group limits the impact of the varying propensity scores (as displayed in the right panel of Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

At the same time, it also contributes to small standard deviations (DKK 8,000–11,000), thereby inflating the normalized difference to 0.65.

Let us move on to the other covariates listed in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."). Once LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} is controlled for, the following covariates are also balanced with normalized differences less than 0.25: worker/job characteristics (age, …, private-sector jobs), and own and spousal capital income and deductions (CIi​86\text{CI}\_{i86}, Di​86\text{D}\_{i86}, CIi​86w\text{CI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}}, Di​86w\text{D}\_{i86}^{\text{w}}). These balanced covariates lend credibility to our estimation results. As a result, the main difference between the treated and control individuals lies in wives’ labor income LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}}. The treated individuals have higher LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} and thus are pushed upward to the middle bracket by the reform. By contrast, the control individuals have lower LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} and thus remain in the bottom bracket due to the joint taxation. Although using variation in spousal income as a source of identification is not new in the literature, e.g., Eissa ([1995](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib12), [1996](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib13)), we leverage it with the joint taxation introduced by the reform.

Finally, we clarify our identification assumption. The DID design assumes that, in the absence of the treatment, the average outcome among the treated individuals evolves in parallel with that among the control individuals (Lechner, [2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib36)). Since these individuals differ exclusively in wives’ labor income LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}}, this assumption essentially states that LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} serves as an instrumental variable: it affects the treatment (i.e., bracket locations and, thus, tax rates) and, only through the treatment, affects outcome dynamics. Although we confirm the first requirement (i.e., relevance) in Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S5 "5 Estimation results ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

## 4 Danish administrative data

We utilize population-wide Danish administrative data constructed from three register-based sources: tax return data, IDA (an acronym for “Integreret Database for Arbejdsmarkedsforskning” translated as the Integrated Database for Labor Market Research), and job spell data. These data are maintained by Statistics Denmark, cover all legal residents in Denmark aged 15–74 (on the 31st of December each year) since 1980, and share a common individual ID.

#### Tax return data.

The tax return data are effectively identical to the annual panel data used by Kleven and Schultz ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)), and contain variables such as marital status and precisely measured individual income (LI, CI, D, LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}}, CIw\text{CI}^{\text{w}}, Dw\text{D}^{\text{w}}). We use the tax return data as, among other things, inputs to the tax simulator to simulate the bracket locations (used in Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3 "3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") for details on the tax return data in the overview of the tax simulator.

#### IDA.

IDA is an annual panel constructed from several registers (e.g., social security and tax registers), and contains extensive information on workers and jobs, such as gross hourly wages and worker/job characteristics listed in Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."). In the data, we observe employment status on the 28th of November each year. Employment is thus defined as holding a primary job on this specific date, referred to as a November job hereafter in this paper. IDA contains gross hourly wages for a November job each year, which serve as our key outcome variable; see Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A4 "Appendix D Computation of outcome variables: wages and hours ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") for details on the computation of gross hourly wages. Finally, note that we distinguish hourly wages for a November job from annual labor income (LI).

#### Job spell data.

The job spell data are constructed from employer-reported income tax reports, cover all primary job spells since 1985, and contain (i) the start and end dates of each spell and (ii) hours worked in each spell each year. The unit of observation is thus person-spell-year, as opposed to person-year in the tax return data and IDA. To link these three data sources, we construct an annual panel of November jobs from the job spell data by extracting job spells ongoing on the 28th of November each year. In this “November-job” annual panel, the unit of observation is person-year. Using the variables (i) and (ii), we then compute daily hours worked for a November job each year, which serve as our second outcome variable; see Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A4 "Appendix D Computation of outcome variables: wages and hours ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") for details on the computation of daily hours worked.

#### Data construction.

We link the tax return data, IDA, and the “November-job” data using the common individual ID each year over the sample period 1981–1993. Although wages and hours are missing among non-employed individuals observed in the tax return data and IDA, we retain all observations regardless of employment status. The constructed dataset is an annual panel covering 1981–1993 and contains the following variables: wages, hours, worker/job characteristics, individual income, bracket locations, and effective marginal tax rates. The availability of both gross hourly wages and daily hours worked, together with the tax return data, is a novel and advantageous feature of our dataset.555In addition to these two outcome variables, we also utilize gross annual earnings, annual hours worked, and variables regarding promotions and job-to-job transitions, all of which are described in the corresponding analyses below.

## 5 Estimation results

This section presents nonparametric graphical evidence, regression results, and implied elasticities regarding the effects of taxes on various outcomes. We first study wage responses and subsequently show that these results survive all threats to identification. To analyze the channels through which wages respond to taxes, we next study promotions and job-to-job transitions. Finally, we compare the responses of hourly wages, annual earnings, and labor supply.

### 5.1 Wage responses by the low-income group

#### Graphical evidence.

Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A. Harmon, Bo Honoré, Niels Johannesen, Daiji Kawaguchi, Francis Kramarz, Claus T. Kreiner, Jakob R. Munch, Fabien Postel-Vinay, Andrew Shephard, Oskar N. Skans, Linh T. Tô, Shintaro Yamaguchi, and seminar/conference participants at Aarhus University, CREST, EALE, IIPF, Osaka University, RIETI, Royal Holloway, and ZEW for their comments. Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") presents wage responses by the low-income group (120,000≤LIi​86<160,000120,000\leq\text{LI}\_{i86}<160,000). Outcome Yi​tY\_{it} is the log\log of real gross hourly wages for a November job that individual ii holds in year tt. The left panel plots Yt¯−Y86¯\overline{Y\_{t}}-\overline{Y\_{86}} for t=81,…,93t=81,...,93 by treatment status, where Yt¯\overline{Y\_{t}} denotes mean Yi​tY\_{it} over ii. Before the reform, the wage dynamics are parallel, which supports our identification assumption. After the reform, the treated individuals, who are pushed upward from the bottom bracket to the middle bracket, experience lower wage growth than the control individuals, who remain in the bottom bracket. Furthermore, the wage dynamics gradually diverge: the wage growth rate among the treated individuals is lower than that among the control individuals by a small margin from 1986 to 1987, but by approximately 1.5 percentage points from 1986 to 1993—a sizable difference given that their overall wage growth rate is approximately 15 percent from 1986 to 1993. The left panel provides compelling nonparametric graphical evidence regarding the negative and accumulating effects of taxes on wages.

#### Regression analysis.

To facilitate inference, we turn to regression analysis and estimate the following two-way fixed effect model for individual ii and year t=81,…,93t=81,...,93:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Yi​t=αi+∑j≠86αj⋅Y​e​a​rt=j+∑j≠86βj⋅Y​e​a​rt=j⋅T​r​e​a​t​e​di+ui​t.Y\_{it}=\alpha\_{i}+\sum\_{j\neq 86}\alpha\_{j}\cdot Year\_{t=j}+\sum\_{j\neq 86}\beta\_{j}\cdot Year\_{t=j}\cdot Treated\_{i}+u\_{it}. |  | (2) |

This specification is standard in the literature on DID and event studies (Miller, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib41)). Outcome Yi​tY\_{it} remains as defined above: the log\log of real gross hourly wages for a November job that individual ii holds in year tt. αi\alpha\_{i} is an individual fixed effect. αj\alpha\_{j} is a year fixed effect, Y​e​a​rt=jYear\_{t=j} is a dummy variable that equals one if year tt equals jj, and t=86t=86 serves as the excluded reference year. T​r​e​a​t​e​diTreated\_{i} is a dummy variable that equals one if individual ii is treated. βt\beta\_{t} are the parameters of interest and measure differences in wage dynamics between the treated and control individuals before the reform (β81\beta\_{81}, …, β85\beta\_{85}) and after the reform (β87\beta\_{87}, …, β93\beta\_{93}). ui​tu\_{it} is an error term. Standard errors are clustered at the individual level (Bertrand et al., [2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib5)).

The right panel of Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") plots the point estimates of βt\beta\_{t} for t=81,…,93t=81,...,93 with their 95% confidence intervals. The regression results align with the graphical evidence in the left panel. First, reassuringly, none of the pre-reform effects (β81^\widehat{\beta\_{81}}, …, β85^\widehat{\beta\_{85}}) statistically differ from zero, which suggests that the parallel trends assumption is plausible. Next, the post-reform effect for 1987 (β87^\widehat{\beta\_{87}}) is statistically insignificant, implying sluggish responses due to optimization frictions. The subsequent post-reform effects (β88^\widehat{\beta\_{88}}, …, β93^\widehat{\beta\_{93}}) are all negative and significant. Furthermore, the point estimates tend to decrease over time, approximately from zero to −-0.015. These results clearly show the dynamic and accumulating effects of taxes on wages.

#### Bracket locations.

Next, we examine bracket locations in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."). The left (right) panel plots the fractions of individuals located in the bottom (middle, respectively) bracket by treatment status. Bracket locations from 1981 to 1983 are missing due to data limitations. The treated and control individuals were in similar brackets on average between 1984 and 1985, and in the bottom bracket in 1986, as defined by the treatment assignment ([3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3.Ex1 "3.2 Treated and control individuals ‣ 3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Although the treated individuals are pushed upward to the middle bracket by the reform, their bracket movement is purely mechanical: in the absence of behavioral responses to the reform, they are in the middle bracket under the 1987 tax system, i.e., M~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{M}}^{87}(z\_{i86}) in the treatment assignment ([3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3.Ex1 "3.2 Treated and control individuals ‣ 3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Given that their income generally changes in 1987, i.e., zi​86≠zi​87z\_{i86}\neq z\_{i87}, their actual brackets in 1987 may deviate from the middle bracket. Despite this non-compliance with the assigned tax bracket, the treated individuals are 20–40 percentage points more likely to be in the middle bracket from 1987 onward. Finally, Figure [E.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A5.F3 "Figure E.3 ‣ Appendix E Additional figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

#### Elasticity.

Due to non-compliance with the assigned tax brackets, the estimated DID coefficients βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}} in Equation ([2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S5.E2 "In Regression analysis. ‣ 5.1 Wage responses by the low-income group ‣ 5 Estimation results ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.")) should be interpreted as intention-to-treat (ITT) effects. On the other hand, treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effects, which scale up ITT effects to account for non-compliance, are also of policy interest. Furthermore, to put the estimation results into context, we need an elasticity with respect to net-of-tax rates. Therefore, we convert the year-by-year ITT effects βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}} for the post-reform period into a TOT elasticity. Inspired by Gruber et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib15)) and Jakobsen et al. ([2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib23)), we compute this elasticity in two steps: first, we convert the year-by-year ITT effects βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}} into a TOT effect using the treatment assignment T​r​e​a​t​e​diTreated\_{i} as an instrumental variable (IV), and then we convert this TOT effect into a TOT elasticity using mechanical changes in net-of-tax rates.666Alternatively, one could use wives’ labor income in 1986 (LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}}), which is our source of identification, as a continuous IV. In such cases, researchers often transform or discretize continuous IVs (Angrist and Pischke, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib3)). Due to the lack of general guidelines on these procedures, we opt to use the binary IV T​r​e​a​t​e​diTreated\_{i}.

In the first step, we compute a TOT effect by estimating the following two-way fixed effect model for individual ii and year t=84,…,93t=84,...,93:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Yi​t=αi+∑j≠86αj⋅Y​e​a​rt=j+βTOT⋅P​o​s​tt⋅Mi​t+ui​t.Y\_{it}=\alpha\_{i}+\sum\_{j\neq 86}\alpha\_{j}\cdot Year\_{t=j}+\beta^{\text{TOT}}\cdot Post\_{t}\cdot M\_{it}+u\_{it}. |  | (3) |

P​o​s​ttPost\_{t} is a dummy variable that equals one if year tt is in the post-reform period, i.e., t≥87t\geq 87. Mi​tM\_{it} is a dummy variable that equals one if individual ii is located in the middle or top brackets in year tt, and zero if located in the bottom or none of the three brackets. As already shown in Figure [E.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A5.F3 "Figure E.3 ‣ Appendix E Additional figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Standard errors are clustered at the individual level. Notice that in this regression, year tt starts from 84, rather than 81, because bracket locations from 1981 to 1983 are missing, which does not pose a concern given our focus on the post-reform period.

Third, the exclusion restriction is supported by the parallel pre-reform trends found in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

In the second step, we compute the elasticity of outcome YY (e.g., wages) with respect to net-of-tax rates as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ϵ^:=βTOT^avg​[Δ​log⁡(1−τiMech)|Treated]−avg​[Δ​log⁡(1−τiMech)|Control].\widehat{\epsilon}:=\frac{\widehat{\beta^{\text{TOT}}}}{\text{avg}[\ \Delta\log(1-\tau\_{i}^{\text{Mech}})\ |\ \text{Treated}\ ]-\text{avg}[\ \Delta\log(1-\tau\_{i}^{\text{Mech}})\ |\ \text{Control}\ ]}. |  | (4) |

The two terms in the denominator represent mechanical changes in net-of-tax rates among the treated and control individuals, respectively. Specifically, avg[⋅|Treated]\text{avg}[\ \cdot\ |\ \text{Treated}\ ] denotes an average over the treated ii, and the mechanical changes are defined as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Δ​log⁡(1−τiMech):=log⁡(1−τ~87​(zi​86))−log⁡(1−τ86​(zi​86)).\Delta\log(1-\tau\_{i}^{\text{Mech}}):=\log(1-\widetilde{\tau}^{87}(z\_{i86}))-\log(1-\tau^{86}(z\_{i86})). |  |

τ86​(zi​86)\tau^{86}(z\_{i86}) and τ~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\tau}^{87}(z\_{i86}) denote tax rates that individual ii with 1986 income zi​86z\_{i86} faces under the 1986 tax system and under the inflation-adjusted 1987 tax system, respectively. This definition of the mechanical changes aligns with the treatment assignment ([3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3.Ex1 "3.2 Treated and control individuals ‣ 3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

We compute τ86​(zi​86)\tau^{86}(z\_{i86}) as an effective marginal tax rate on labor income (LI) using the tax simulator, which encodes the details of the Danish income tax system. Specifically, given the main input zi​86={LIi​86,CIi​86,Di​86,LIi​86w,CIi​86w,Di​86w}z\_{i86}=\{\text{LI}\_{i86},\text{CI}\_{i86},\text{D}\_{i86},\text{LI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86},\text{CI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86},\text{D}^{\text{w}}\_{i86}\}, it is computed as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | τ86​(zi​86):=T86​(LIi​86+100,CIi​86,Di​86,LIi​86w,CIi​86w,Di​86w)−T86​(LIi​86,CIi​86,Di​86,LIi​86w,CIi​86w,Di​86w)100,\tau^{86}(z\_{i86}):=\frac{T^{86}(\text{LI}\_{i86}+100,\text{CI}\_{i86},\text{D}\_{i86},\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}},\text{CI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}},\text{D}\_{i86}^{\text{w}})-T^{86}(\text{LI}\_{i86},\text{CI}\_{i86},\text{D}\_{i86},\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}},\text{CI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}},\text{D}\_{i86}^{\text{w}})}{100}, |  |

where T86​(⋅)T^{86}(\cdot) denotes simulated tax liabilities under the 1986 tax system (DKK 100 in 1986 == USD 30 in 2022). τ~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\tau}^{87}(z\_{i86}) is computed analogously.

([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib37)) show that a first-stage FF-statistic greater than 104.7 ensures a correct size of 5% for a two-sided tt-test for a 2SLS coefficient in broad settings of just-identified, single IV cases. Since the first-stage results are almost identical across outcomes, we report them only for gross hourly wages. The IV estimation, specified by Equation ([3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S5.E3 "In Elasticity. ‣ 5.1 Wage responses by the low-income group ‣ 5 Estimation results ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Although not reported in the table, the standard deviations of Δ​log⁡(1−τiMech)\Delta\log(1-\tau\_{i}^{\text{Mech}}) are only approximately 10-4; thus, we treat these mechanical changes as constants. Finally, we obtain an elasticity ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon} of 0.369, with a standard error (s.e.^\widehat{\text{s.e.}}) of 0.065 computed using the delta method.

We repeat the analysis for the medium-income group (160,000≤LIi​86<280,000160,000\leq\text{LI}\_{i86}<280,000) by providing graphical evidence, DID coefficients βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}}, and an implied elasticity ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon}.

The left panel shows that the wage dynamics are almost parallel before and after the reform. Although β81^\widehat{\beta\_{81}} statistically differs from zero, the subsequent pre-reform effects (β82^\widehat{\beta\_{82}}, …, β85^\widehat{\beta\_{85}}) do not. In addition, the post-reform effects (β87^\widehat{\beta\_{87}}, …, β93^\widehat{\beta\_{93}}) are all insignificant. As a result, the implied elasticity ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon} is 0.112 (s.e.^=0.089\widehat{\text{s.e.}}=0.089), which is also insignificant and smaller than that of the low-income group (refer to Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

#### Summing up.

We found heterogeneous wage responses across income levels. The low-income group responds to taxes negatively and dynamically, with an elasticity of 0.4. Their elasticity is relatively large because our DID design captures the dynamic and accumulating effects, rather than short-run effects attenuated by optimization frictions. Specifically, over seven years after the reform, workers gradually change their behavior in response to taxes while overcoming optimization frictions. These gradual responses lead to the accumulating effects, which are reflected in their relatively large elasticity. Therefore, our estimated elasticities will not be frictional ones (Martínez et al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib39)) but can be interpreted as structural ones that are more relevant for long-run welfare (Chetty, [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib8); Chetty et al., [2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib9); Kleven and Waseem, [2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib29); Kleven et al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib32)).

For the medium-income group, the effects of taxes on wages are smaller and statistically insignificant. Their elasticity is 0.1, close to those estimated by Blomquist and Selin ([2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib6)) for a similar sample (Swedish married males of working age in the 1980s). Larger tax effects among lower-income groups are also found by Zidar ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib51)) using state-level data and variations in the United States. These findings on heterogeneous responses across income levels have implications for tax policies targeted toward low-income workers, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States. Given the relatively large elasticity and novel accumulating effects, the following analysis focuses on the low-income group and studies internal validity, the channels through which wages respond to taxes, and the responses of annual earnings and labor supply.

### 5.3 Threats to identification

This subsection shows that the estimation results for the low-income group survive the following threats to identification: compositional changes of employed workers, violations of the exclusion restriction, income reallocation between spouses, bunching, and robustness to alternative definitions of the low-income group.

#### Compositional changes.

Recall that our sample consists of workers employed in the baseline pre-reform year 1986. Imposing a sample restriction that requires workers to be employed after the reform would introduce selection bias, as post-reform employment status is itself an outcome affected by the treatment—a bad control problem (Angrist and Pischke, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib3)). Consequently, outside of 1986, workers may be non-employed, which leads to missing wages, or may drop from the sample due to reasons such as death or emigration. To account for this attrition, we transform our unbalanced panel into a quasi-balanced panel by filling in each missing observation with an employment dummy set to zero. In this quasi-balanced panel, the filled-in observations have only the individual ID, year variable, and employment dummy, with all other variables missing.

The left panel shows high employment rates, higher than 85 percent, before and after the reform. The right panel plots DID coefficients βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}} from a linear probability model with the same specification as Equation ([2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S5.E2 "In Regression analysis. ‣ 5.1 Wage responses by the low-income group ‣ 5 Estimation results ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

The statistically significant pre-reform effects (β81^\widehat{\beta\_{81}}, …, β85^\widehat{\beta\_{85}}) suggest a violation of the parallel trends assumption, implying that the post-reform effects (β87^\widehat{\beta\_{87}}, …, β93^\widehat{\beta\_{93}}) cannot be interpreted causally. Therefore, the post-reform employment rates between the treated and control individuals differ statistically, but not causally, only by 1–2 percentage points. Note that this small difference does not necessarily threaten identification: if exits from employment are random, the composition of employed workers remains constant over time, which validates our DID design. For identification, a key concern is not the quantity but the quality of employed workers: if the treated (control) individuals with higher (lower, respectively) wages exit employment, these compositional changes of employed workers will create the spurious negative effects of taxes on wages.

To examine this concern, Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

The 1986 level is normalized to zero. The treated and control individuals exhibit a similar pattern: compared to workers employed in 1986, workers employed outside of 1986 earned wages in 1986 that were lower by less than 0.5 percent. As displayed in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

These results indicate that the compositional changes of employed workers (measured by their 1986 wages) occur to a slight but similar degree among the treated and control individuals, thereby not creating the spurious negative effects of taxes on wages.

The comparison is based on normalized differences and reveals the same pattern as that of the 1986 wages: the compositional changes of employed workers (measured by their 1986 covariates) occur to a slight but similar degree among the treated and control individuals. To sum up, seven years after the reform, the employed treated individuals remain similar to the employed control individuals in terms of their 1986 wages and covariates (except for wives’ labor income).

#### Exclusion restriction.

Our empirical strategy leverages the variation in wives’ labor income in 1986 (LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}}) and effectively uses it as an instrumental variable in the DID design. We conduct a placebo test to verify the exclusion restriction, which requires that LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} affects outcome dynamics only through the treatment (i.e., bracket locations and, thus, tax rates). Specifically, we show parallel pre- and post-reform outcome dynamics between placebo-treated and placebo-control individuals who differ exclusively in LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} but face nearly identical tax rates (i.e., the absence of the treatment).

We construct placebo-treated and placebo-control individuals from the control individuals in the low-income group using their wives’ labor income in 1986 (LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}}). Figure [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") plots the kernel density estimates of LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} by treatment status for the low-income group. As expected, the treated individuals have higher mean LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} than the control individuals. If we select two control individuals with low LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}}, they will be away from the middle-bracket cutoff and thus face similar tax rates over time. Based on this idea, we define a placebo group (composed of placebo-treated and placebo-control individuals) as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Placebo-treated: | Q1≤LIi​86wC<Q2\displaystyle\ \text{Q}\_{1}\leq\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{wC}}<\text{Q}\_{2} |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Placebo-control: | LIi​86wC<Q1,\displaystyle\ \text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{wC}}<\text{Q}\_{1}, |  | (5) |

where LIi​86wC\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{wC}} denotes LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} of the control individuals in the low-income group, and Q1\text{Q}\_{1} and Q2\text{Q}\_{2} denote the first and second quartiles of LIi​86wC\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{wC}}, respectively. (Q1\text{Q}\_{1} ≈\approx DKK 60,000 and Q2\text{Q}\_{2} ≈\approx DKK 90,000.)

Let us check their bracket locations and pre-reform covariates.

The table also shows that the placebo group is similar to the low-income group. Furthermore, the placebo group has a larger normalized difference in LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} (3.07) than the low-income group (1.12), thereby having a fair chance of exhibiting non-parallel outcome dynamics—evidence against the exclusion restriction. These observations suggest the validity of our placebo test.

Except for β81^\widehat{\beta\_{81}}, the wage dynamics are parallel and not statistically different from each other before and after the reform; that is, LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}} does not affect the outcome dynamics in the absence of the treatment. Therefore, this placebo test provides evidence supporting the exclusion restriction.

#### Income reallocation.

This placebo test also addresses another threat to identification. After the reform introduced the joint taxation, individual ii’s tax rate depends not only on own income (LIi​t,CIi​t,Di​t\text{LI}\_{it},\text{CI}\_{it},\text{D}\_{it}) but also on spousal income (LIi​tw,CIi​tw,Di​tw\text{LI}^{\text{w}}\_{it},\text{CI}^{\text{w}}\_{it},\text{D}^{\text{w}}\_{it}) for t≥87t\geq 87. Since the treated and control individuals in the low-income group differed (exclusively) in LIi​86w\text{LI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86} before the reform, they may have differential incentives to reallocate income (e.g., through labor supply) between spouses within a household to minimize tax liabilities after the reform. Such reallocation confounds our interpretation of wage responses as reflecting the effects of marginal tax rates, thereby threatening identification.

We clarify two points regarding these differential incentives to reallocate income. First, such incentives may arise even without the joint taxation, provided that the treated and control individuals differ in LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}} and optimize at the household level. However, this concern is ruled out by the parallel pre-reform trends shown in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."). Thus, our primary concern is that the joint taxation induces these incentives. Second, such incentives persist even if the treated and control individuals face the same tax rate, as long as they differ in LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}} under the joint taxation.

Our placebo test finds no effect of income reallocation. Since the placebo-treated and placebo-control individuals face nearly identical tax rates and differ (exclusively) in LIi​86w\text{LI}^{\text{w}}\_{i86}, their wage responses reflect the effects of income reallocation, rather than marginal tax rates. However, as shown in Figure [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."), their wage dynamics remain parallel both before and after the reform, providing evidence that the introduction of the joint taxation does not affect the outcome dynamics through income reallocation.

#### Bunching.

As Kleven and Schultz ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)) point out, quasi-experimental approaches exploiting tax reforms assume that individuals do not bunch at bracket cutoffs; otherwise, such bunching might bias estimates. Figure [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F10 "Figure 10 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") plots the frequencies of individuals by their taxable income relative to the middle-bracket cutoff in bins of DKK 1,000 for the post-reform period 1987–1993. We deflate the taxable income and middle-bracket cutoffs to the 1986 price level. The figure shows no spikes around the cutoff; indeed, the lack of bunching among our sample (i.e., male wage-earners) at the middle-bracket cutoff aligns with Chetty et al. ([2011](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib9)) and le Maire and Schjerning ([2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib35)), who find bunching primarily among females, self-employed workers, and at the top-bracket cutoff in Denmark.

#### Robustness checks.

Recall that the low-income group is defined as 120,000≤LIi​86<160,000120,000\leq\text{LI}\_{i86}<160,000. To check robustness to modest changes to this definition, we construct four alternative low-income groups by adding or subtracting 5,000 to either boundary of 120,000≤LIi​86<160,000120,000\leq\text{LI}\_{i86}<160,000. These four groups exhibit robust wage responses in Figure [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F11 "Figure 11 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

These results align with Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

### 5.4 Two channels: promotions and job-to-job transitions

This subsection studies two channels through which wages can respond to taxes: promotions and job-to-job transitions. Workers respond to lower marginal tax rates potentially by accumulating human capital or working harder, both of which will lead to promotions, or by searching for higher-paying jobs, which will lead to job-to-job transitions. These dynamic channels can explain the negative and accumulating effects of taxes on wages; see Kleven et al. ([2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib32)) for similar channels.

#### Promotions.

We examine promotions using information on occupational ranks. Statistics Denmark classifies employed workers into six ranked categories. In 1986, most workers in the low-income group fell into one of the bottom three categories: unskilled (34 percent), skilled (29 percent), and low-level white-collar (25 percent). We construct two outcome variables. First, we aggregate the six categories into two by creating a dummy variable that equals one if workers are ranked as skilled or higher; otherwise, it equals zero. Workers with this dummy variable equal to one are referred to as skilled hereafter in this paper. Second and similarly, we create another dummy variable that equals one if workers are ranked as low-level white-collar or higher; otherwise, it equals zero. Workers with this second dummy variable equal to one are referred to as white-collar.

Like the wage responses, we provide graphical evidence, DID coefficients βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}}, and implied semi-elasticities ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon}. The left panels of Figure [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

The two outcomes exhibit similar patterns. After the reform, the treated individuals are approximately 0.5 percentage points less likely to be promoted to skilled or white-collar workers than the control individuals; thus, higher marginal tax rates discourage promotions, arguably by reducing incentives to accumulate human capital or work harder. The right panels plot the DID coefficients βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}} from the same model as Equation ([2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S5.E2 "In Regression analysis. ‣ 5.1 Wage responses by the low-income group ‣ 5 Estimation results ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Approximately half of the post-reform effects are statistically significant. For the first outcome (i.e., skilled or not), the implied semi-elasticity ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon} is 0.149 (s.e.^=0.077\widehat{\text{s.e.}}=0.077) with a pp-value of 0.05. For the second outcome (i.e., white-collar or not), ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon} is 0.226 (s.e.^=0.081\widehat{\text{s.e.}}=0.081) and thus significant (refer to Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first quasi-experimental evidence on the negative effects of taxes on promotions. Our findings lend empirical support to recent research on optimal taxation with human capital accumulation or career effects (Stantcheva, [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib49)). In addition, our findings complement structural approaches that study the effects of income taxes on wages and hours by estimating learning-by-doing models (Keane and Rogerson, [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib25), [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib26)) or Ben-Porath models (Heckman et al., [1998](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib17), [1999](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib18)).

#### Job-to-job transitions.

We define a job-to-job transition (JJT) between two consecutive years t−1t-1 and tt based on three conditions: (i) workplace IDs differ between t−1t-1 and tt, (ii) wages are higher in tt than in t−1t-1, and (iii) a worker is unemployed in neither t−1t-1 nor tt. In the first condition, we use workplace IDs rather than firm IDs due to data limitations. Our definition of JJTs is thus somewhat broad because it includes internal transfers involving workplace changes. Next, we impose the second condition to focus on workers climbing up job/wage ladders; in Denmark, 35 percent of job changes result in wage cuts (Jolivet et al., [2006](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib24)). Finally, the third condition excludes involuntary job changes caused by layoffs. In this paper, unemployment is defined as receiving unemployment benefits.

Our outcome is the probability of making at least one JJT between 81 and year tt (t=82,…,93t=82,...,93). We clarify two points. First, recall that we observe only a November job for each worker and year; thus, we observe whether a worker makes zero or one JJT between two consecutive years t−1t-1 and tt. We calculate the number of JJTs between 81 and tt by summing up the number of JJTs between 81 and 82, between 82 and 83, …, and between t−1t-1 and tt. Second, as predicted by a standard on-the-job search model, workers are less likely to make JJTs once they have settled into high-paying jobs. Therefore, to capture worker dynamics along their job/wage ladders, we examine not recent JJTs between t−1t-1 and tt, but rather whether workers have made any JJTs between 8181 and tt, i.e., since the beginning of the sample period.

We provide graphical evidence, DID coefficients βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}}, and an implied semi-elasticity ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon}. The left panel of Figure [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F13 "Figure 13 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

The last three post-reform effects (β91^\widehat{\beta\_{91}}, β92^\widehat{\beta\_{92}}, β93^\widehat{\beta\_{93}}) are statistically significant. The implied semi-elasticity ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon} is 0.370 (s.e.^=0.144\widehat{\text{s.e.}}=0.144) and thus significant.

Although Gentry and Hubbard ([2004](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib14)) also find negative effects of taxes on JJTs, we provide the first quasi-experimental evidence. Our findings lend empirical support to welfare analyses based on job search models using structural approaches (Kreiner et al., [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib33); Shephard, [2017](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib47)) or sufficient statistics approaches (Chetty, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib7); Kroft et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib34)). Finally, JJTs are closely related to location choices, i.e., domestic or international migration. Given recent interest in the effects of taxes on migration (Kleven et al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib31)), exploring the interaction between JJTs and migration offers an interesting avenue for future research.

### 5.5 Comparing responses of hourly wages, annual earnings, and labor supply

#### Annual earnings.

We use annual earnings from a November job as an outcome variable. These earnings correspond to the numerator in our definition of hourly wages. Note that labor income (LI) includes annual earnings from both November and non-November jobs. We use annual earnings from a November job, rather than LI, for two reasons. First, these earnings are, by definition, decomposed into hourly wages times annual hours worked for that job, which facilitates the comparison of their elasticities. Second and relatedly, since LI includes earnings from non-November jobs, it is inconsistent with our focus on November jobs.

Annual earnings exhibit responses similar to those of hourly wages displayed in Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

The implied elasticity ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon} is 0.519 (s.e.^=0.143\widehat{\text{s.e.}}=0.143) and thus somewhat larger than the wage elasticity of 0.369 (0.065).

Our elasticity of annual earnings is closely related to the literature on the elasticity of taxable income. Specifically, Kleven and Schultz ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)) estimate the elasticity of labor income using a series of Danish tax reforms, including the 1987 reform. They report in Table 7 that their elasticity estimates based solely on the 1987 reform are 0.1, which is smaller than our elasticity estimate of 0.5.

Two possible reasons for this difference in the magnitude of estimates are empirical strategies and sample selection. Kleven and Schultz ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)) follow an approach developed by Gruber and Saez ([2002](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib16)), which often compares individuals with varying pre-reform income patterns while exploiting reform-induced variation in tax rates across all tax brackets. Although this approach uses broad samples, thereby providing a comprehensive view of tax effects, it faces challenges in validating the parallel trends assumption (Jakobsen and Søgaard, [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib22)). By contrast, our empirical strategy compares individuals with similar pre-reform income patterns while focusing on reform-induced movements between the bottom and middle brackets, which makes the parallel trends assumption more plausible. To achieve this transparent identification, we impose more restrictions on our sample than Kleven and Schultz ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)).

#### Labor supply.

Figure [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F15 "Figure 15 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") presents labor supply responses along the intensive margin. Outcome Yi​tY\_{it} is the log\log of daily (in the top panels) or annual (in the bottom panels) hours worked for a November job that individual ii holds in year tt. Daily hours worked are missing from 1981 to 1984 due to data limitations. Annual hours worked correspond to the denominator in our definition of hourly wages. The left panels provide graphical evidence, whereas the right panels plot DID coefficients βt^\widehat{\beta\_{t}} using the same y-axis scale as the figures related to wage responses (e.g., Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx2.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ Figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.")). Daily and annual hours worked exhibit similar responses: neither the pre- nor post-reform effects statistically differ from zero. Each implied elasticity ϵ^\widehat{\epsilon} is 0.000 (s.e.^=0.078\widehat{\text{s.e.}}=0.078) for daily hours and 0.132 (s.e.^=0.128\widehat{\text{s.e.}}=0.128) for annual hours. These insignificant results align with existing findings for married males (Meghir and Phillips, [2010](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib40)).

#### Summing up.

We found that the elasticities of hourly wages, annual earnings, daily hours, and annual hours (with respect to net-of-tax rates) are 0.369, 0.519, 0.000, and 0.132, respectively, with the latter two being statistically insignificant (refer to Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") for a summary). We highlight two points. First, the labor supply elasticities are insignificant and smaller than the wage elasticity. This finding has implications for optimal taxation because the literature derives tax formulae primarily by focusing on labor supply responses (Piketty and Saez, [2013](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib42)). Second, the elasticity of annual earnings—a key parameter in the literature (Saez et al., [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib46))—is, by definition, decomposed into the elasticity of hourly wages plus that of annual hours worked. Our estimates indicate that the elasticity of annual earnings (0.519) is primarily driven by that of hourly wages (0.369), rather than by that of annual hours worked (0.132, insignificant).

Related to the second point, Martínez et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib39)) also provide credible quasi-experimental evidence on both wage and labor supply responses. They exploit a large and salient tax holiday induced by a reform in Switzerland, during which earned income was untaxed. Given that the tax holiday was a one-time tax cut, their empirical settings are well-suited for identifying intertemporal responses. Using biennial repeated cross-sectional data, they find the positive but insignificant elasticities of both hourly wages and monthly hours (with respect to net-of-tax rates). With some evidence on bonus shifting, they conclude that the wage responses are likely driven by tax avoidance.

In contrast to Martínez et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib39)), the current paper estimates the dynamic and accumulating effects of taxes, rather than the intertemporal effect of a one-time tax cut. In addition to the positive and significant elasticity of hourly wages, we found that wages respond to taxes through promotions or job-to-job transitions, rather than through tax avoidance. Therefore, our anatomy of behavioral responses, inspired by Slemrod ([1996](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib48)), provides new insights that complement those of Martínez et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib39)).

## 6 Conclusion

This paper provided quasi-experimental evidence on the effects of income taxes on gross hourly wages by utilizing administrative data and a tax reform in Denmark. Our findings among working married males are as follows. First, taxes have heterogeneous effects on wages across income levels. Low-income workers respond to taxes negatively and dynamically; their elasticity of wages with respect to net-of-tax rates is 0.4. For medium-income workers, the effects are smaller and statistically insignificant. Second, wages respond to taxes through promotions or job-to-job transitions. Third, neither daily nor annual hours worked significantly respond to taxes; consequently, annual earnings respond to taxes primarily through hourly wages, rather than through labor supply.

Finally, we briefly discuss external validity. Although Denmark differs from the United States in many dimensions, the two countries share similar patterns in the elasticity of taxable income (Gruber and Saez, [2002](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib16); Kleven and Schultz, [2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)). Moreover, we found heterogeneity similar to that found by Zidar ([2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib51)) for the United States: larger tax effects among lower-income groups. Therefore, we believe that our findings are also relevant to other countries, such as the United States.

These omitted income concepts are explained later in Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A2 "Appendix B Overview of the tax simulator ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Notes: All monetary values are in Danish Krone (DKK), and DKK 1 in 1986 equals USD 0.3 in 2022. The regional tax rate is the sum of the municipal, county, and Church tax rates. The Church taxes are minuscule and are paid only by members of the Church of Denmark (“Folkekirken”). The regional tax rates in the table are averages across municipalities. The bottom tax rate in 1986 includes social security contributions levied at a tax rate of 5.5 percent. “Yes” in the “Joint” column means that if married individuals are not liable for the middle taxes and have unused allowances (calculated as the bracket cutoff DKK 130,000 minus their taxable income LI+[CI>0]\text{LI}+[\text{CI}>0]), these unused allowances can be transferred to their spouses.

Notes: The table lists the means of covariates in 1986 by treatment status for each income group. Standard deviations are in parentheses. “N. d.” denotes a normalized difference, defined as X¯T−X¯C(ST2+SC2)/2\frac{\overline{X}\_{T}-\overline{X}\_{C}}{\sqrt{(S\_{T}^{2}+S\_{C}^{2})/2}} for each covariate, where X¯T\overline{X}\_{T} and X¯C\overline{X}\_{C} are the means among the treated and control individuals respectively, and STS\_{T} and SCS\_{C} are the corresponding standard deviations. As a general guideline, a covariate is considered as balanced between the treated and control individuals if its normalized difference is less than 0.25. All monetary values are in Danish Krone (DKK), and DKK 1 in 1986 equals USD 0.3 in 2022. Children are defined as individuals younger than 17 years old. Low education is defined as completing primary education. Middle education is defined as completing high school or vocational education. High education is defined as holding a bachelor’s, master’s, or Ph.D. degree. Full-time jobs are defined as working more than 30 hours per week. The sample is males who, in 1986, were (i) younger than 50 years old and (ii) employed on the 28th of November. Furthermore, in 1986, (iii) they were married, and (iv) their wives had (strictly) positive labor income. The treated and control individuals are defined by the treatment assignment ([3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3.Ex1 "3.2 Treated and control individuals ‣ 3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Notes: The table lists the main elasticity estimates, along with related results. Standard errors are in parentheses. We compute an elasticity in two steps. In the first step, we compute a TOT effect βTOT^\widehat{\beta^{\text{TOT}}} by estimating Equation ([3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S5.E3 "In Elasticity. ‣ 5.1 Wage responses by the low-income group ‣ 5 Estimation results ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Note that Lee et al. ([2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib37)) show that a first-stage FF-statistic greater than 104.7 ensures a correct size of 5% for a two-sided tt-test for a 2SLS coefficient in broad settings of just-identified, single IV cases. Since the first-stage results are almost identical across outcomes, we report them only for gross hourly wages. Standard errors are clustered at the individual level. In the second step, using Equation ([4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S5.E4 "In Elasticity. ‣ 5.1 Wage responses by the low-income group ‣ 5 Estimation results ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Although not reported in the table, the standard deviations of Δ​log⁡(1−τiMech)\Delta\log(1-\tau\_{i}^{\text{Mech}}) are only approximately 10-4; thus, we treat the mechanical changes in net-of-tax rates as constants.

Notes: The table lists the means of covariates in 1986 by treatment status for the low-income and placebo groups. Standard deviations are in parentheses. “N. d.” denotes a normalized difference, defined as X¯T−X¯C(ST2+SC2)/2\frac{\overline{X}\_{T}-\overline{X}\_{C}}{\sqrt{(S\_{T}^{2}+S\_{C}^{2})/2}} for each covariate, where X¯T\overline{X}\_{T} and X¯C\overline{X}\_{C} are the means among the treated and control individuals respectively, and STS\_{T} and SCS\_{C} are the corresponding standard deviations. As a general guideline, a covariate is considered as balanced between the treated and control individuals if its normalized difference is less than 0.25. All monetary values are in Danish Krone (DKK), and DKK 1 in 1986 equals USD 0.3 in 2022. Children are defined as individuals younger than 17 years old. Low education is defined as completing primary education. Middle education is defined as completing high school or vocational education. High education is defined as holding a bachelor’s, master’s, or Ph.D. degree. Full-time jobs are defined as working more than 30 hours per week. The sample is males who, in 1986, were (i) younger than 50 years old and (ii) employed on the 28th of November.

## Appendix

## Appendix A Background of the 1987 tax reform

Like other Scandinavian countries, Denmark has a high tax burden. According to Kleven ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib27)), its ratio of tax revenue to GDP in 2012 was 48 percent, higher than that in other developed countries such as Germany (36 percent), the United Kingdom (35 percent), and the United States (25 percent). Denmark collects approximately half of its revenue from individual income taxes.

Before the 1987 reform, the Danish income tax system was characterized by high marginal tax rates and narrow tax bases. As the left panel of Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A. Harmon, Bo Honoré, Niels Johannesen, Daiji Kawaguchi, Francis Kramarz, Claus T. Kreiner, Jakob R. Munch, Fabien Postel-Vinay, Andrew Shephard, Oskar N. Skans, Linh T. Tô, Shintaro Yamaguchi, and seminar/conference participants at Aarhus University, CREST, EALE, IIPF, Osaka University, RIETI, Royal Holloway, and ZEW for their comments. Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") shows, the top marginal tax rate reached 73 percent. Regarding the narrow tax bases, as Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A. Harmon, Bo Honoré, Niels Johannesen, Daiji Kawaguchi, Francis Kramarz, Claus T. Kreiner, Jakob R. Munch, Fabien Postel-Vinay, Andrew Shephard, Oskar N. Skans, Linh T. Tô, Shintaro Yamaguchi, and seminar/conference participants at Aarhus University, CREST, EALE, IIPF, Osaka University, RIETI, Royal Holloway, and ZEW for their comments. Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin.") shows, capital income was negative on average due to interest payments on debt, such as mortgage loans. This negative capital income thus narrowed the tax bases calculated as LI+CI−D\text{LI}+\text{CI}-\text{D}.

Given these points, the reform was designed to broaden the tax bases and narrow the difference in marginal tax rates across the three brackets. First, it changed the tax bases for the middle and top brackets from LI+CI−D\text{LI}+\text{CI}-\text{D} to LI+[CI>0]\text{LI}+[\text{CI}>0] and LI+[CI>60​k]\text{LI}+[\text{CI}>60\text{k}], respectively. The reform thus broadened the tax bases by reducing the tax value of negative capital income and itemized deductions. Second, Figure [E.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#A5.F1 "Figure E.1 ‣ Appendix E Additional figures ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

The tax rates and bracket cutoffs are taken from Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#Sx1.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Tables ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

For simplicity, we here assume single individuals with zero capital income and deductions (CI=D=0\text{CI}=\text{D}=0). It is clear from the figure that the reform lowered the top and middle tax rates but raised the bottom tax rate, thereby narrowing the difference in marginal tax rates across the three brackets.777Although the reform flattened the tax schedule, it was approximately ex-ante revenue neutral by introducing green taxes levied on the consumption of natural resources.

## Appendix B Overview of the tax simulator

This appendix section explains the inputs of the simulator (including data sources), all income concepts necessary for the simulations, and the outputs of the simulator used in the empirical analysis.

### B.1 Inputs of the tax simulator

The tax simulator takes as input information on the Danish income tax system (e.g., statutory tax rates) and information on individual income and demographic characteristics. The former information is primarily obtained from the website of the Danish Ministry of Taxation at <https://www.skm.dk>. The latter information is obtained from population-wide Danish administrative datasets. We refer to these datasets by their filenames on the server of Statistics Denmark used for the computations (ECONAU project 707275 via Aarhus University). The filenames are INDK, INDH, and PERSONER.

The three datasets are annual panels constructed from several registers (e.g., tax returns), cover all legal residents in Denmark aged 15–74 (on the 31st of December each year) since 1980, share a common individual ID, and contain extensive information. INDK and INDH contain administrative records on income tax assessments and public transfers, such as unemployment and sick leave benefits; we use variables regarding individual income and joint taxation. PERSONER contains information on demographic characteristics; we use variables regarding the municipality of residence, marital status, and the ID of his or her spouse (if married).

We construct a dataset for the simulations as follows. We first link INDK, INDH, and PERSONER using the common individual ID and a year variable; thus, the unit of observation is person-year. We then create variables regarding spousal income using the individual ID, his or her income, and the spousal ID. To this dataset, we next add information on regional taxes (e.g., statutory tax rates) using the municipal ID and a year variable. Information on national taxes is coded in the simulator.

### B.2 All income concepts

The constructed dataset contains precise, individual-level measures of five income concepts necessary for the simulations.

For accurate simulations, we need two additional income concepts of minor importance for our sample. The first is personal income, which includes labor income plus public transfers (e.g., unemployment and sick leave benefits) minus pension contributions. The second is stock income, which includes dividends and realized capital gains from shares (Kleven and Schultz, [2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib28)). In the main text, we omit these two income concepts for ease of exposition.

### B.3 Outputs of the tax simulator

Using all the necessary income concepts (LI, CI, …, LIw\text{LI}^{\text{w}}, CIw\text{CI}^{\text{w}}, …), demographic characteristics, and information on the Danish income tax system, we simulate bracket locations and effective marginal tax rates for individuals each year over the period 1984–1993. These outputs are missing from 1981 to 1983 due to data limitations. We describe and use the bracket locations in Section [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S3 "3 Empirical strategy ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Among single males, the two distributions do not sufficiently overlap due to a lack of variation to exploit; the treated individuals generally have higher LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86} and thus are mechanically pushed upward to the middle bracket under the 1987 tax system, i.e., M~87​(zi​86)\widetilde{\text{M}}^{87}(z\_{i86}).

Note that when two distributions do not sufficiently overlap, it is challenging to robustly control for pre-reform labor income LIi​86\text{LI}\_{i86}. In such cases, linear regression relies on extrapolation and becomes sensitive to the specifications of control variables (Abadie et al., [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib2); Imbens, [2015](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib20)). For example, the literature on the elasticity of taxable income often finds estimates sensitive to the specifications of pre-reform income. This sensitivity occurs because researchers often compare a certain income group affected by a tax reform to an unaffected, higher- or lower-income group (Saez et al., [2012](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib46)).

## Appendix D Computation of outcome variables: wages and hours

#### Gross hourly wages.

Gross hourly wages in IDA are computed as annual earnings from a November job divided by annual hours worked for that job. Note that labor income (LI) includes annual earnings from both November and non-November jobs.

The annual earnings (i.e., the numerator) are reported to the tax authorities by employers for income tax purposes and are subject to minimal misreporting and measurement errors. These annual earnings include regular pay, overtime pay, bonuses, vacation pay, and illness allowances, but not employer pension contributions.

The annual hours (i.e., the denominator) in IDA are estimated from annual pension contribution records (known as ATP for “Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension”) by leveraging the fact that mandatory employer contributions to a supplementary pension scheme depend only on hours worked by individual employees (Lund and Vejlin, [2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib38)). These annual hours do not include overtime work, vacation, and periods of absence due to illness; among these missing components, overtime work will be the most important.

We argue that the lack of overtime work is not a serious concern for three reasons. First, Lund and Vejlin ([2016](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib38)) document that the estimated hourly wages are precise by comparing them to hourly wages obtained from another register called “Lønstatistik” (Wage and Salary Statistics). Second, Hummels et al. ([2014](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#bib.bib19)) utilize data on overtime work obtained from IDA in 2006 and document that annual hours including overtime work are highly correlated with those excluding overtime work. Third, the lack of overtime work will pose a threat to identification in the DID design if overtime work correlates with both outcome dynamics (e.g., wage dynamics) and our instrumental variable (i.e., wives’ labor income LIi​86w\text{LI}\_{i86}^{\text{w}})—a violation of the exclusion restriction. However, in Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.16483v1#S5 "5 Estimation results ‣ Income Taxes, Gross Hourly Wages, and the Anatomy of Behavioral Responses: Evidence from a Danish Tax ReformWe would like to thank Mike Brewer, Pierre Cahuc, Manasi Deshpande, Peter Fredriksson, Chishio Furukawa, Nikolaj A.

Tô, Shintaro Yamaguchi, and seminar/conference participants at Aarhus University, CREST, EALE, IIPF, Osaka University, RIETI, Royal Holloway, and ZEW for their comments. Financial support from Aarhus University, RIETI, and Royal Holloway is gratefully acknowledged. Sumiya would also like to thank AUFF and, in particular, the Associate Professor Starting Grant awarded to Rune Vejlin."), we provide evidence against such a correlation by showing parallel pre-reform outcome dynamics and by conducting a placebo test.

#### Daily hours worked.

Daily hours worked in the “November-job” data are computed as annual hours worked for a November job divided by annual days worked for that job. The annual hours (i.e., the numerator) are estimated similarly to the annual hours in IDA (described above); indeed, they are highly correlated. The annual days (i.e., the denominator) are determined from the start and end dates of each job.888We cannot use IDA to compute daily hours worked because it does not contain the start and end dates of jobs.
