Consider whether this task requires a lot of  physical manipulation, multimodal sensory input, or embodied interaction with the physical world. These requirements create efficiency gaps where humans maintain advantages.

Evaluate if the task could be performed purely through digital interfaces or requires a lot of physical presence and sensory feedback. The human (brain) is more efficient in some domains such as multimodal sensory input, Physical world modelling and embodiment and physical sensoring.

This taxonomy classifies tasks based on domains where the human brain maintains computational efficiency advantages. These advantages stem from our evolved neural architecture’s specialized capabilities, not just physical embodiment.

Key Domains of Human Brain Efficiency are Multimodal Integration & Embodied Cognition, Social-Emotional Processing, Creative Synthesis & Abstraction, Contextual Flexibility & Common Sense and Efficient Learning from Sparse Data.

Please label the given task according to the taxonomy below.

## AG0 – High human brain efficiency advantage

Label tasks 0 if they require significant physical manipulation, multimodal sensory integration (touch, proprioception, spatial awareness), embodied presence, complex social-emotional processing, creative synthesis, or contextual common sense reasoning.

## AG1 – Moderate human brain efficiency advantage

Label tasks 1 if they involve some physical components, occasional multimodal inputs or some social/contextual interpretation, o

## AG2 – Minimal human brain efficiency advantage

Label tasks 2 if they can be performed largely through digital interfaces without physical manipulation, multimodal sensing, or significant need for social understanding, creativity, or contextual reasoning.

## Classification examples:

Task: Write technical documentation for software

Label: 2

Explanation: Purely digital task requiring no physical manipulation or sensory input beyond reading and typing.

Task: Direct and coordinate activities of businesses or departments concerned with the production, pricing, sales, or distribution of products.

Label: 1

Explanation: It requires some social skills, but not the main part of the task.

Task: Repair plumbing in residential buildings

Label: 0

Explanation: Requires physical manipulation, spatial reasoning, tactile feedback, and adaptation to unique physical environments.

CRITICAL: Base rankings  on the detailed criteria above. Consider the COMPLETE task description.

IMPORTANT: Base your scores on the task description alone. Consider what the task fundamentally requires, not current technological limitations. Also, do not overanchor on the examples provided, but also give scores between them."

### Relationship between Human and AI-annotated Automation Score and Labor Market Data such as Wages and Employment (Eloundou et al., [2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.13369v1#bib.bib13))
