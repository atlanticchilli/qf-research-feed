evaluate theta_star on Long-horizon and Blind hold-out windows
export tabular summaries
```

In our implementation, the “export tabular summaries” step is backed by deterministic machine-readable outputs (e.g., configuration json, per-bar ledger csv, robustness summaries, and invariant-audit files) that allow independent regeneration of the manuscript tables/figures and backtest-to-replay reconciliation, as summarized in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

### 2.2 The Signal-Modular Parameter Space

Our framework deliberately treats the underlying alpha-generation logic
as a black-box mapping

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f:ℐt×Θ→St,f:\mathcal{I}\_{t}\times\Theta\rightarrow S\_{t}, |  |

where ℐt\mathcal{I}\_{t} denotes the information set available at time tt,
Θ\Theta the hyperparameter space, and St∈{−1,0,1}S\_{t}\in\{-1,0,1\} the target
position or trading signal. In the STRICT4H case study, the core
momentum signal is derived from the normalized divergence between fast
and slow Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) of the 4-hour close,
compressed into [0,1][0,1] via a smooth tanh\tanh transform and combined
with auxiliary mean-reversion and breakout channels. The details of this
construction are implementation-specific; in this section we focus on
the structure and constraints of Θ\Theta rather than on the functional
form of the alpha engine itself.

While the AutoQuant architecture is signal-agnostic—meaning it can
wrap any signal-generating function f​(⋅)f(\cdot)—the specific
hyperparameter search space Θ\Theta is optimized for trend-following
and mean-reversion families on cryptocurrency perpetual futures. These
structures reflect the dominant algorithmic flows we observe in this
market. Extending the framework to high-frequency market-making or
arbitrage strategies would require redefining Θ\Theta and the
associated cost-model primitives, although the validation pipeline in
Sections [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S5 "5 System Architecture and Implementation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") would remain unchanged.
Importantly, AutoQuant does not attempt to invent ff automatically in
this manuscript; the novelty is to enforce strict semantics and provide
an auditable selection and screening pipeline for θ∈Θ\theta\in\Theta.

Momentum score:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | mt​(θmomentum)=12​[1+tanh⁡(EMAfast,t−EMAslow,tσ​(θmomentum)​EMAslow,t)].m\_{t}(\theta\_{\mathrm{momentum}})=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+\tanh\left(\frac{\mathrm{EMA}\_{\mathrm{fast},t}-\mathrm{EMA}\_{\mathrm{slow},t}}{\sigma(\theta\_{\mathrm{momentum}})\,\mathrm{EMA}\_{\mathrm{slow},t}}\right)\right]. |  | (1) |

Here θmomentum≥0\theta\_{\mathrm{momentum}}\geq 0 is a volatility-scaling
hyperparameter and σ​(θmomentum)\sigma(\theta\_{\mathrm{momentum}}) is a smooth,
monotonically increasing scaling function that maps
θmomentum\theta\_{\mathrm{momentum}} to the same units as the EMA spread, ensuring
that mt​(θmomentum)m\_{t}(\theta\_{\mathrm{momentum}}) remains in [0,1][0,1].

Composite score:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Ct=wmom⋅mt+(1−wmom)⋅at.C\_{t}=w\_{\mathrm{mom}}\cdot m\_{t}+(1-w\_{\mathrm{mom}})\cdot a\_{t}. |  | (2) |

Here wmom∈[0,1]w\_{\mathrm{mom}}\in[0,1] is a fixed weight and
At={at,1,…,at,K}A\_{t}=\{a\_{t,1},\dots,a\_{t,K}\} denotes the collection of enabled
mean-reversion (anomaly) sub-scores at time tt, each mapped by a
monotone squashing function to a unit-free range in [0,1][0,1] (e.g.,
based on Bollinger-band deviations and/or tail-quantile exceedances).
We aggregate these sub-scores into a single scalar anomaly score
at:=maxk⁡at,ka\_{t}:=\max\_{k}a\_{t,k}, aligned with our implementation.

Signal generation:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Signalt={+1,Ct≥τtlong,−1,Ct≤1−τtshort,0,otherwise.\mathrm{Signal}\_{t}=\begin{cases}+1,&C\_{t}\geq\tau\_{t}^{\mathrm{long}},\\ -1,&C\_{t}\leq 1-\tau\_{t}^{\mathrm{short}},\\ 0,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases} |  | (3) |

Signal & Risk Parameters. Instead of enumerating
implementation-specific variable names, we define the hyperparameter
space Θ\Theta in terms of a small number of interpretable blocks. The
momentum and mean-reversion block controls the EMA lookback lengths,
volatility-scaling factors, and Bollinger-band widths and tail quantiles
that determine how quickly the strategy reacts to trends or reversals.
The risk-control block specifies minimum holding times, cooldown periods
after exits, ATR-based stop-loss and take-profit multipliers, and
several exposure-smoothing and maximum-exposure constraints. The
Bayesian optimization stage explores Θ\Theta within fixed bounds chosen
to respect realistic leverage, exposure, and cost constraints. Bounds
are set *ex ante* based on exchange-rule feasibility and common
practitioner ranges, and are not tuned on a per-window basis.

Table 3: Minimal STRICT4H hyperparameter summary (Θ\Theta) with default bounds and fallbacks. Ranges correspond to the default Stage I Optuna search space (Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") replication code). “Default” denotes the fallback value used when a parameter is omitted; many risk knobs default to 0 (disabled) and are enabled only when explicitly set by the tuned configuration.

| Block | Parameter | Range (default) | Constraint / interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Momentum | ema\_fast | 6–32 (12) | EMA span in 4h bars; must be shorter than ema\_slow. |
| Momentum | ema\_slow | 20–96 (26) | EMA span in 4h bars; ema\_fast << ema\_slow. |
| Momentum | ema\_threshold | 0.0005–0.0060 (0.003) | Entry threshold on EMA spread (decimal units). |
| Mean-rev | bb\_period | 10–30 (20) | Bollinger lookback in 4h bars. |
| Mean-rev | bb\_dev | 1.0–2.5 (2.0) | Band width in standard deviations. |
| Risk | min\_hold\_bars | 1–6 (1) | Minimum holding duration in 4h bars. |
| Risk | cooldown\_hours | 0–8 (0) | Cooldown after exits to reduce rapid flip-flopping. |
| Risk | atr\_period | 0–30 (0) | ATR period in 4h bars; 0 disables ATR-based exits. |
| Risk | atr\_k\_sl, atr\_k\_tp | 0–3 / 0–5 (0) | ATR stop-loss / take-profit multipliers; 0 disables. |
| Risk | max\_exposure\_abs | 0–5 (0) | Account-level exposure cap (in notional equity multiples); 0 disables. |
| Funding | funding\_bias\_thr\_bps | 0–10 (0) | Soft threshold ϑbias\vartheta\_{\mathrm{bias}} (bps) before raising entry thresholds under adverse funding. |
| Funding | funding\_bias\_k\_thr\_per\_bps | 0–0.005 (0) | Slope κ\kappa: threshold increase per 1.0 funding-rate decimal above ϑbias\vartheta\_{\mathrm{bias}} (converted to decimal). |

Funding & Cost Parameters. To mitigate adverse funding costs, we
introduce a soft funding-bias mechanism that raises entry thresholds in
periods of expensive carry. Let f​rtfr\_{t} denote the 8-hour funding rate
(in decimal units) observed from an external funding series and aligned
to the 4-hour grid via carry-forward, and let τbase\tau\_{\mathrm{base}} be a baseline
long-entry threshold. For long positions we define an effective
threshold

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | τlong​(t)=τbase+κ⋅max⁡(|f​rt|−ϑbias/10000,0),\tau\_{\mathrm{long}}(t)=\tau\_{\mathrm{base}}+\kappa\cdot\max\bigl(|fr\_{t}|-\vartheta\_{\mathrm{bias}}/10000,0\bigr), |  | (4) |

where ϑbias≥0\vartheta\_{\mathrm{bias}}\geq 0 is an activation threshold
(expressed in basis points; we divide by 10,000 to match f​rtfr\_{t}’s decimal
units) and κ≥0\kappa\geq 0 controls how quickly the threshold increases
as funding moves deeper into the tails (in threshold units per 1.0
funding-rate decimal). An analogous expression applies to the short side,
with the sign of f​rtfr\_{t} reversed in the adverse-direction
case. When κ=0\kappa=0 the funding-bias channel is effectively disabled, and
the backtest reduces to a pure price-based strategy with realistic but
funding-agnostic trading costs.

The optimization process in Stage I is guided by a well-defined
objective function. The goal is to maximize a single scalar objective
dominated by the cost-adjusted annualized return. While other
performance metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and win
rate are computed concurrently and can be combined into a fixed-weight
composite score for diagnostic purposes, the Bayesian optimization
process itself is not a multi-objective one. The trade-offs between risk
and return are primarily addressed through the subsequent robustness
screening in Stage II, rather than by treating metric weights as tunable
hyperparameters.

Formally, Stage I solves

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | maxθ∈Θ⁡J​(θ),J​(θ):=rann​(θ),\max\_{\theta\in\Theta}J(\theta),\qquad J(\theta):=r\_{\mathrm{ann}}(\theta), |  | (5) |

where rann​(θ)r\_{\mathrm{ann}}(\theta) is the annualized net return computed from
the STRICT4H net-return series under the Stage I window and the baseline
cost profile (defined below in Eq. ([6](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.E6 "In Performance metrics. ‣ 2.2 The Signal-Modular Parameter Space ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"))).

#### Performance metrics.

We define the primary performance metric, annualized return rannr\_{\mathrm{ann}},
based on the geometric compounding of the 4-hour strategy returns over
the entire backtest period. Let R\_tot denote the total compounded
return of the strategy over N 4-hour bars and let AF be the
annualization factor (set to 2190, i.e., 6 periods per day ×\times 365 days
per year). We compute

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | rann=(1+Rtot)A​F/N−1.r\_{\mathrm{ann}}=(1+R\_{\mathrm{tot}})^{AF/N}-1. |  | (6) |

Unless otherwise stated, we report annualized return as CAGR in decimal
units (e.g., 0.10 = 10%). For readability, we also report CAGR in
percentage units in our empirical tables and figures.
Maximum drawdown (MaxDD) is reported as the peak-to-trough equity decline
over the window, expressed as a fraction in [0,1][0,1] (e.g., 0.30 = 30%).

### 2.3 Stage I: Bayesian Auto-Tuning under Realistic Costs

The first stage
of our framework employs Bayesian optimization to efficiently search the
vast parameter space. We utilize the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator
(TPE) algorithm [bergstra2011algorithms], as implemented in the Optuna framework [akiba2019optuna], to guide the
search. The process begins by defining a wide range for each parameter,
allowing the optimizer to explore diverse regions of the configuration
space. In each trial, the optimizer suggests a new parameter set, a
backtest is executed, and the resulting scalar objective function value
is reported back. The TPE algorithm uses this history to build a
probabilistic model, progressively focusing the search on more promising
regions that are likely to yield high cost-adjusted performance.

#### Why TPE (and why not grid / evolutionary / GP-BO)?

We select TPE because our search space Θ\Theta contains mixed
continuous/discrete parameters, conditional blocks (many knobs are
enabled/disabled), and hard feasibility constraints. In this setting, the
TPE family is a practical and widely used sampler for conditional search
spaces [bergstra2011algorithms, akiba2019optuna] and performs well in
compute-limited regimes where only a modest number of strict backtest
evaluations is feasible. By contrast, grid search scales poorly with
dimension and discretization choices; random search is a strong baseline
for hyperparameter optimization under limited budgets [bergstra2012random];
evolutionary methods can be effective but often require larger evaluation
budgets and more careful constraint handling [goldberg1989ga, storn1997de, hansen2006cmaes];
and Gaussian-process Bayesian optimization is less convenient for
high-dimensional conditional spaces. Importantly, AutoQuant
is sampler-agnostic: any black-box optimizer that proposes θ\theta and
consumes scalar scores can be substituted without changing the strict
execution/cost semantics or the Stage II screening policies.

In the BTC/USDT STRICT4H case study reported in this manuscript, we fix
the Stage I search budget ex ante at Nopt=40N\_{\mathrm{opt}}=40 TPE trials
on the training window. This budget is deliberately modest and is not
intended to exhaustively explore the strategy space; it is used to
generate a small but diverse candidate pool whose robustness is then
tested in Stage II.

We use annualized net return as the Stage I scalar objective (see the
pseudo-code in Section [2.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS1 "2.1 Algorithmic Summary (Pseudo-code) ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")) to keep the optimization
problem simple and to avoid embedding additional risk preferences into
the sampler. Risk and fragility controls (drawdown and turnover caps,
worst-month floors, and scenario-aggregated stability criteria) are
enforced in Stage II as explicit, auditable policy constraints (see
Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")). Alternative objectives (e.g.,
Sharpe-based or multi-objective formulations) are compatible with the
pipeline but are not the focus of this manuscript.

A key design choice in our case study is that Stage I and Stage II evaluations share the same STRICT4H execution and funding-alignment semantics; Stage I differs only in its role (Training-only objective under a baseline cost profile) while Stage II re-evaluates a fixed candidate pool under additional windows and cost-mis-specification scenarios.

A critical feature of this stage is that the backtest engine already
incorporates a realistic trading-cost model (Section [4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.SS4 "4.4 Trading Cost Model and Constraints ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")).
In our implementation this component is named RealisticTradingCosts.
This ensures that the optimization is grounded in a realistic
assessment of market friction from the outset, preventing the discovery
of spurious strategies that are only profitable in a frictionless
environment. However, despite this realism, Stage I is conducted on a
single, primary data window and cost assumption. It is therefore still
susceptible to overfitting, necessitating a subsequent, more rigorous
validation stage. The output of Stage I is a large pool of
high-performing candidate parameter sets, ranked by their objective
function scores.

Budget note. For the manuscript’s direct comparison
tables, we use a higher Stage I budget (120 trials) to avoid underpowered
“best-of-40” comparisons. We retain Nopt=40N\_{\mathrm{opt}}=40 as a
compute-limited baseline for the deflated Sharpe ratio (DSR) diagnostic and for illustrating
how the pipeline behaves under modest budgets; the replication package
includes both budgets and their corresponding best-so-far curves.

Table 4: Stage I optimization best-so-far curve versus trial budget (BTC/USDT training). The score is the Stage I scalar objective (annualized net return under strict execution and the baseline cost profile) and is reported in decimal units. Values are taken from the machine-readable replication artifacts.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Budget (trials) | Best score so far | Best trial ID so far |
| 10 | 0.0174 | 7 |
| 20 | 0.0362 | 14 |
| 40 | 0.1172 | 38 |
| 60 | 0.1334 | 53 |
| 80 | 0.1508 | 67 |
| 100 | 0.1590 | 85 |
| 120 | 0.1590 | 85 |

Optimizer baseline. As a minimal baseline under the same STRICT training window and objective, we compare the best-of-NN curve of TPE against random sampling [bergstra2012random] in Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Why TPE (and why not grid / evolutionary / GP-BO)? ‣ 2.3 Stage I: Bayesian Auto-Tuning under Realistic Costs ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

| Budget NN | TPE best | Random best (mean±\pmsd) |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 20 | 0.0362 | -0.7832 ±\pm 0.4848 |

| 100 | 0.1590 | -0.4600 ±\pm 0.5163 |
| 120 | 0.1590 | -0.3580 ±\pm 0.6763 |

Compute budget disclosure. The dominant cost driver is the number of rigorous STRICT4H backtest evaluations. Stage I runs Nopt∈{40,120}N\_{\mathrm{opt}}\in\{40,120\} TPE trials on the Training window (one STRICT4H backtest per trial). Stage II re-evaluates a fixed candidate pool across a small cost-scenario grid and window segments; in our reproducible BTC snapshot, the screening applies 9 cost scenarios to the top 40 candidates over the combined Training+Validation window (7,262 4-hour bars), totaling 360 strict backtest runs, plus a small number of long-horizon and blind hold-out stress-test evaluations. All experiments are CPU-only (no GPU required). On a representative workstation (Windows 11; AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX, 16C/32T), end-to-end runtime is typically hours to under one day per asset under these budgets.

### 2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening

The candidate
parameter sets from Stage I are then passed to the second stage for a
rigorous “double-screening” validation. This stage utilizes our
STRICT4H backtest engine, which is architected to eliminate common
sources of backtest inflation and ensure consistency with live
execution. The key features of this engine include:

Strict T+1 Execution: A signal generated at the close of 4-hour bar t,
using all information available up to that point, only affects the
strategy’s position and profit-and-loss (PnL) calculation starting from
the subsequent bar, t+1. This strictly prohibits intra-bar execution and
prevents look-ahead bias.

No-Look-Ahead Funding Model: Funding costs are calculated and applied on
a bar-by-bar basis. Funding rates are treated as an external time series
and are aligned to the 4-hour grid via carry-forward. The backtest uses
only the funding values available up to each bar timestamp (no
backfilling from future funding updates), scaled by the bar’s duration
(4 hours). The engine is architecturally prevented from peeking into the
future path of funding rates.

Funding-gate ablation. To isolate whether funding-aware alignment rules matter beyond simply charging funding as a cost, we keep STRICT execution and all costs fixed and disable only the funding-related gating/bias rules. Table [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T6 "Table 6 ‣ 2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") reports the resulting change in performance for a representative tuned configuration.

Table 6: Funding gate ablation (trial 109). Costs and STRICT execution are held fixed; only funding-related gating/bias rules are disabled.

| Variant | Train monthly geom | Train MaxDD | Val monthly geom | Val MaxDD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | 0.089 | 0.331 | 0.004 | 0.365 |
| NoFundingGates | 0.067 | 0.331 | 0.004 | 0.365 |

To make the execution semantics explicit, let St∈{−1,0,1}S\_{t}\in\{-1,0,1\} be
the directional signal computed at the close of bar tt using only
ℐt\mathcal{I}\_{t}. STRICT4H enforces a strict t+1t\!+\!1 delay by applying
an *executed* signed nominal exposure πt\pi\_{t} during bar tt that
is computed from the previous bar’s signal St−1S\_{t-1} after exposure
caps/smoothing and other fixed (ex ante) risk controls. Given the
close-to-close market return rtmktr^{\mathrm{mkt}}\_{t} in
Eq. ([9](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.E9 "In 4.1 Instruments and Data Sources ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")), the raw strategy return is
rtraw=πt​rtmktr^{\mathrm{raw}}\_{t}=\pi\_{t}\,r^{\mathrm{mkt}}\_{t}.
Transaction costs are applied on exposure changes at bar boundaries,
Δ​πt=πt−πt−1\Delta\pi\_{t}=\pi\_{t}-\pi\_{t-1}, with fees and slippage proportional
to |Δ​πt||\Delta\pi\_{t}|. Funding costs are accrued on the notional exposure
πt\pi\_{t} using the aligned 8-hour funding-rate series (scaled to the
bar length). We therefore define the per-bar net return as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | rtnet=rtraw−Cfee,t−Cslip,t−Cfund,t.r^{\mathrm{net}}\_{t}=r^{\mathrm{raw}}\_{t}-C\_{\mathrm{fee},t}-C\_{\mathrm{slip},t}-C\_{\mathrm{fund},t}. |  | (7) |

All reported performance metrics in Section 6 are computed from the
resulting {rtnet}\{r^{\mathrm{net}}\_{t}\} series unless otherwise stated.

Table 7: Core STRICT4H symbols, units, and accounting bases. Unless stated otherwise, returns and costs are in decimal units; bps inputs are converted by dividing by 10,000.

| Symbol | Units / range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| StS\_{t} | {−1,0,1}\{-1,0,1\} | Directional signal computed at the close of bar tt. |
| πt\pi\_{t} | unitless, bounded | Executed signed nominal exposure held during bar tt, applied with a strict t+1t\!+\!1 delay from St−1S\_{t-1} after fixed caps/smoothing and other risk controls. |
| rtmktr^{\mathrm{mkt}}\_{t} | decimal | Close-to-close market return of the underlying over bar tt. |
| Cfee,t,Cslip,tC\_{\mathrm{fee},t},C\_{\mathrm{slip},t} | decimal | Turnover-based trading costs applied at bar boundaries, proportional to |Δ​πt||\Delta\pi\_{t}| (bps inputs apply to notional turnover). |
| Cfund,tC\_{\mathrm{fund},t} | decimal | Funding cost accrued on notional exposure πt\pi\_{t} using the aligned 8-hour funding-rate series (scaled to 4-hour bars). |

The double-screening protocol consists of two parallel validation
streams applied to a fixed pool of Stage I candidates; there is no
further re-optimization in this stage:

Held-Out Window Robustness: To test for temporal stability, the
performance of each candidate parameter set is re-evaluated across
multiple, overlapping rolling windows of fixed length (2000 bars in our
case study, stepped forward by 500 bars)
that are held out from the Stage I optimization but may be reused within
Stage II. This process is distinct from a traditional walk-forward
optimization, as we do not re-train on each window; rather, we apply the
same fixed parameter set to different time periods to assess its
consistency.

Cost Scenario Robustness: The same parameter sets are re-evaluated under
a bounded set of cost-mis-specification profiles. In the current
implementation, this stream has two components. First, for
stable-candidate filtering we use a discrete sensitivity grid that
varies taker fees and funding multipliers (taker\_bps
∈{3,4,6}\in\{3,4,6\} and fund​\_​mult∈{0.5,1.0,1.5}\mathrm{fund\\_mult}\in\{0.5,1.0,1.5\}),
producing scenario-aggregated monthly and drawdown summaries for each
candidate. This grid intentionally includes both optimistic and
pessimistic perturbations around a conservative baseline to make cost
sensitivity explicit. Second, as an additional stress test on selected
configurations, we report pessimistic-cost scaling scenarios that
multiply transaction-related costs (fees and slippage) by fixed factors
(e.g., 2×2\times and 3×3\times), together with a funding-off stress.
These stress tests probe the sensitivity of conclusions to increased
market friction while keeping the execution semantics fixed.

The selection of “stable candidates” from this stage is a multi-step
process. First, we apply a set of absolute robustness thresholds to
filter out underperforming configurations. In the BTC STRICT4H
experiments, these hard-coded rules include minimum average monthly
returns, a floor for the worst-performing month, a ceiling on average
maximum drawdown, and limits on position-switching frequency. Second,
the surviving candidates are ranked based on their average monthly
return (descending) and average maximum drawdown (ascending) on the
training-plus-validation regime. Finally, we select the top-KK
configurations from this ranked list to form the final pool of stable
BTC/USDT STRICT4H candidates.

To make these rules auditable, Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")
reports the exact thresholds used in our stable-candidate filter. In
the replication code, these rules are implemented as an ex-ante filter
over scenario-aggregated performance summaries (followed by a simple
lexicographic ranking by mean performance and drawdown), and they are
not tuned post hoc on a per-experiment basis.

Metric choice note. We rank stable candidates using monthly geometric mean, drawdown, and switching frequency because these are directly interpretable and robust to extreme compounding in high-volatility regimes. Other stability metrics (e.g., Sharpe-, Sortino-, or Calmar-style summaries) can be substituted in the same policy layer; a systematic comparison of screening metrics is left as future work.

Stable-candidate statistics and aggregation.
For a candidate parameter set and a cost scenario ss from the
predefined grid, we compute a net return series {rtnet}\{r^{\mathrm{net}}\_{t}\}
and resample it into calendar-month compounded returns Rm,s=∏t∈m(1+rt,snet)−1R\_{m,s}=\prod\_{t\in m}(1+r^{\mathrm{net}}\_{t,s})-1. We then compute a
scenario-level monthly geometric mean gs=exp⁡(1M​∑mlog⁡(1+max⁡(Rm,s,−0.999999)))−1g\_{s}=\exp(\frac{1}{M}\sum\_{m}\log(1+\max(R\_{m,s},-0.999999)))-1, and report monthly​\_​true=gs\mathrm{monthly\\_true}=g\_{s}.
The stable-candidate filter aggregates these scenario-level statistics
across the scenario grid: mean​\_​monthly​\_​true=𝔼s​[gs]\mathrm{mean\\_monthly\\_true}=\mathbb{E}\_{s}[g\_{s}],
min​\_​monthly​\_​true=mins⁡gs\mathrm{min\\_monthly\\_true}=\min\_{s}g\_{s}, and
maxDD​\_​mean=𝔼s​[maxDDs]\mathrm{maxDD\\_mean}=\mathbb{E}\_{s}[\mathrm{maxDD}\_{s}]. The
position-switch density is computed per scenario as
switch​\_​densitys=#​{Δ​πt≠0}/N\mathrm{switch\\_density}\_{s}=\#\{\Delta\pi\_{t}\neq 0\}/N, and we
report switch​\_​density​\_​mean=𝔼s​[switch​\_​densitys]\mathrm{switch\\_density\\_mean}=\mathbb{E}\_{s}[\mathrm{switch\\_density}\_{s}].
These definitions match the exported robust-summary files referenced in
Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

Table 8: Stable-candidate selection rules used in the BTC/USDT STRICT4H case study. Statistics are aggregated across the predefined cost-scenario grid described in Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). After filtering, we select the top K=5K=5 candidates by sorting mean​\_​monthly​\_​true\mathrm{mean\\_monthly\\_true} descending and maxDD​\_​mean\mathrm{maxDD\\_mean} ascending.

| Statistic | Meaning | Threshold | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mean\_monthly\_true | mean monthly geometric return (across scenarios) | ≥0.005\geq 0.005 | minimum performance |
| min\_monthly\_true | worst-case scenario-level monthly geometric return | ≥0.0\geq 0.0 | downside floor |
| maxDD\_mean | mean maximum drawdown (across scenarios) | ≤0.30\leq 0.30 | drawdown cap |
| switch\_density\_mean | mean position-switch density (across scenarios) | ≤0.12\leq 0.12 | turnover/fragility cap |

### 2.5 Live Guard and Accounting Invariants

The final component of our
methodology is a post-deployment layer designed to promote consistency
and help manage risk in a live trading environment. This layer is explicitly
separated from the Stage I and II optimization and backtesting processes
and acts as a post-deployment overlay.

First, we define a set of full-chain accounting invariants. These are
mathematical identities that must hold, within a small tolerance, across
the entire lifecycle of a strategy instance. For any given parameter
set, key metrics such as cumulative exposure, total fees paid, total
slippage incurred, net funding costs, and total PnL must reconcile
between the offline backtest, a paper trading simulation, and the logs
from a paper-trading or execution run produced by the same code path.
These invariants serve as a powerful tool for auditing system integrity
and detecting divergences in accounting.

Concretely, for each bar tt we record the raw strategy return
rtrawr^{\mathrm{raw}}\_{t} and cost components Cfee,tC\_{\mathrm{fee},t},
Cslip,tC\_{\mathrm{slip},t}, and Cfund,tC\_{\mathrm{fund},t}, and define the net
return

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | rtnet=rtraw−Cfee,t−Cslip,t−Cfund,t.r^{\mathrm{net}}\_{t}=r^{\mathrm{raw}}\_{t}-C\_{\mathrm{fee},t}-C\_{\mathrm{slip},t}-C\_{\mathrm{fund},t}. |  | (8) |

Full-chain audits verify that these components reconcile (within a small
tolerance) across offline backtests, live-style replay, and execution
logs produced by the same code path.

In the replication snapshot used for this manuscript, we validate these
invariants on representative configurations (two BTC STRICT4H baselines
and one ETH STRICT4H aggressive line) and observe exact agreement at the
bar level for the exported signal and exposure series (i.e.,
diff\_signal and diff\_exposure are identically zero in
the full-chain audits). We report these audits as internal consistency
checks; they do not constitute evidence of long-horizon live
performance.
Table [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T9 "Table 9 ‣ 2.5 Live Guard and Accounting Invariants ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") summarizes representative full-chain audit
results for BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT from the replication package.

Table 9: Full-chain audit snapshot (offline backtest vs live-style replay). We report maximum absolute differences in the exported signal and exposure series, together with accounting invariant diffs (all as backtest-minus-live). Values are generated from the STRICT4H fullchain logs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and are intended as system-consistency evidence, not as a live performance claim.

| Asset | Bars | max⁡|Δ​S|\max|\Delta S| | max⁡|Δ​π|\max|\Delta\pi| | trades\_diff | fees\_diff | slip\_diff | fund\_diff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BTC/USDT | 8000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| ETH/USDT | 8299 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Second, we conceptualize a live guard mechanism responsible for
real-time risk supervision. This guard continuously monitors a dashboard
of rolling performance metrics, such as 30-day and 90-day annualized
returns, peak-to-trough drawdown from recent highs, maximum daily loss,
and trade frequency. Based on predefined rules, the guard can issue one
of three decisions: ok, watch, or kill. A “kill” decision triggers an
automatic flattening of the strategy’s position and, depending on the
configured mode, can either temporarily or persistently disable further
trading until an explicit manual resume is issued. This mechanism acts
as a final safety net that is designed to help contain strategy risk
when market conditions deviate significantly from those observed in
historical data.

From an empirical standpoint, the current evidence for the live guard is
deliberately limited. We verify that full-chain accounting invariants
hold to within tight tolerances when replaying STRICT4H logs from
backtests and from a small number of paper-trading or limited live runs, and we
support the design with trade-level guard simulations on historical
data. However, we do not report a broad, multi-year live track record
for the guard itself. Throughout this paper we therefore treat the live
guard as a post-deployment risk-control pattern with preliminary,
configuration-specific evidence rather than as a fully validated
production risk-management system.

### 2.6 Multiple-Testing Adjustment via Deflated Sharpe Ratio

While the bulk of our robustness analysis relies on walk-forward
evaluation and trading-cost stress scenarios, we also report a
simple multiple-testing adjustment for our flagship STRICT4H
configuration. Following [bailey2014deflated], we compute a
normal-approximation deflated Sharpe ratio (DSR-style) using the annualized
Sharpe estimated from the long 4-hour BTC/USDT series (2019-09-08–2025-10-14) and an
estimate of the effective number of trials generated by the AutoQuant pipeline.
Concretely, we approximate the total number of effective trials as
Ntotal∈[Nopt×Nwindows,Nopt×Nwindows×Nscen]N\_{\mathrm{total}}\in[N\_{\mathrm{opt}}\times N\_{\mathrm{windows}},\,N\_{\mathrm{opt}}\times N\_{\mathrm{windows}}\times N\_{\mathrm{scen}}],
where NoptN\_{\mathrm{opt}} is the number of Stage I configurations and
NwindowsN\_{\mathrm{windows}} is the number of rolling evaluation windows used
in Stage II. The upper bound additionally counts the NscenN\_{\mathrm{scen}}
cost-scenario grid evaluations used in stable-candidate screening as
distinct selection degrees of freedom. In our reproducible case study we use Nopt=40N\_{\mathrm{opt}}=40
and a 6000-bar walk-forward grid with 2000-bar windows stepped by 500 bars
(Nwindows=9N\_{\mathrm{windows}}=9) and a 9-scenario grid
(Nscen=3×3=9N\_{\mathrm{scen}}=3\times 3=9), yielding Ntotal∈[360,3240]N\_{\mathrm{total}}\in[360,3240]. In the
replication materials we
provide helper code for recomputing the same statistic under alternative
trial-count assumptions. The resulting DSR-style statistic is interpreted
*only* as an internal sanity check, as the calculation relies on stylized
assumptions about return independence, approximate normality, and a
closed-form approximation. In the current reproducible snapshot, the long-window
Sharpe is close to zero, and the DSR-style diagnostic does not suggest that
Sharpe alone provides strong evidence against a zero-true-Sharpe null after
accounting for multiple trials. We therefore place greater weight on the
structural safeguards provided by our walk-forward and cost-stress experiments.

#### Trial budget and overfitting diagnostics.

To address the concern that Nopt=40N\_{\mathrm{opt}}=40 may be insufficient,
we report a best-so-far objective curve versus trial budget for the BTC
Stage I study in the replication package. In this reproducible snapshot,
the best score improves materially beyond 40 trials and plateaus only
around 100–120 trials, implying that a 40-trial budget should be viewed
as a compute-limited setting rather than as a converged optimum. We
therefore interpret our empirical results as evidence about sensitivity
and auditability, not as a claim of global optimality within Θ\Theta.

We also add an explicit multiple-testing diagnostic based on combinatorial
symmetric cross-validation (CSCV) and the probability of backtest
overfitting (PBO) [bailey2017pbo], computed on the Stage I candidate pool. The resulting
PBO estimate in our BTC snapshot is materially above zero (PBO =0.586=0.586
under a standard 8-segment CSCV design with 70 combinatorial splits over
the top-40 Stage I candidates), indicating that data-snooping risk remains
substantial even under strict execution and realistic cost modeling.
These diagnostics are used defensively and are not interpreted as proof
of persistent alpha.

Implementation details for the DSR calculation, together with exact
formulas and numerical results for the BTC/USDT anchor case study, are
documented in the accompanying replication code and summarized in
Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). Practically, the DSR-style statistic serves as a consistency
check for the walk-forward and cost-stress evidence rather than as
standalone proof of economic significance, and its numerical values should
be interpreted in light of the underlying distributional and trial-count
assumptions.

## 3 Related Literature

AutoQuant sits at the intersection of (i) cryptocurrency perpetual
microstructure and its funding- and slippage-driven frictions, (ii)
hyperparameter search and overfitting control in quantitative trading,
and (iii) production-grade risk management and backtest-to-live
consistency. We therefore draw from three related literature streams:
realistic backtesting under market frictions, Bayesian optimization for
strategy parameterization, and risk overlays and accounting
invariants for auditable deployment in production decision-support
systems. This framing is consistent with digital finance and fintech
research, which emphasizes that measurement, execution, and control
layers are integral to operational decision support and model governance
[philippon2016fintech, gomber2017digitalfinance].

### 3.1 Expert Systems, Decision Support, and Auditable Pipelines

AutoQuant is positioned as an *expert-system-like*, rule-based decision-support pipeline: it
codifies non-negotiable semantics and constraints as a knowledge base,
uses an inference procedure (Bayesian search plus policy-driven screening)
to select robust configurations, and exports auditable artifacts for
traceability (Section [2.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS1 "2.1 Algorithmic Summary (Pseudo-code) ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T2 "Table 2 ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")).
This emphasis is aligned with decision-support objectives in operational
fintech contexts, where governance depends on explicit measurement,
execution, and control layers rather than on opaque “best backtest”
reports [philippon2016fintech, gomber2017digitalfinance].
In this sense, AutoQuant is closer to an execution-aware, audit-oriented
AutoML workflow [hutter2019automl] than to a strategy-generation
system: the signal family is fixed, and the contribution lies in making
configuration selection reproducible and inspectable under strict t+1t\!+\!1
semantics and cost realism.

### 3.2 Backtesting and Execution Biases in Cryptocurrency Markets

Realistic backtesting is difficult even in traditional assets
[lopez2018advances], and the problem is amplified in cryptocurrency
perpetual futures. The 24/7 trading cycle, coupled with frequent and
extreme volatility, makes data alignment and timestamp integrity
critical [liu2020riskscrypto, liu2022commonriskcrypto]. Early work in this area
highlighted the prevalence of look-ahead bias, where information
unavailable at the time of a decision is improperly included in a
backtest, leading to systematically inflated performance metrics.
Recent work also documents substantial microstructure frictions,
arbitrage constraints, and liquidity fragmentation across venues in
cryptocurrency markets [makarov2020trading], reinforcing the need
for conservative execution assumptions in backtests.

More specific to perpetual contracts, the modeling of funding payments
represents a significant source of potential error. Both academic
studies and practitioner reports emphasize that funding payments and
contract design features can be first-order for both profitability and
risk, and that naive backtests that omit or misalign funding can be
materially misleading [ackerer2024perpetualpricing, jermann2023pricingperpetual, gornall2025fundingcrisisproofed]. Recent work also studies market-quality
implications of perpetual-futures design [ruan2025perpetualquality] and
documents strong linkages between spot and derivatives markets, including
price discovery effects in Bitcoin futures [hung2021pricediscovery, shynkevich2020infoeff]. Empirical work exploring modeling and
forecasting of perpetual-futures prices for trading applications further
underscores that the data-generation and settlement mechanics of the
contract family matter for inference [malik2023perpetualpricing].
Our work builds upon this literature by architecting a backtest engine
that programmatically enforces T+1 execution and no-look-ahead funding
calculations, moving beyond identification of the problem to providing an
architectural solution.

### 3.3 Parameter Tuning and Bayesian Optimization in Finance

Most quantitative strategies are highly sensitive to parameter choices.
Manual tuning and naive grid search are inefficient and can promote
overfitting [lopez2019seven]. Bayesian optimization and related
methods can navigate large search spaces more efficiently
[snoek2012practical].

Random search provides a competitive and widely used baseline for
hyperparameter optimization under limited evaluation budgets
[bergstra2012random], and evolutionary computation methods (e.g.,
genetic algorithms, differential evolution, and CMA-ES) provide a
complementary family of black-box optimizers with different trade-offs
in constraint handling and sample efficiency
[goldberg1989ga, storn1997de, hansen2006cmaes].

In finance, Bayesian optimization has been applied to find optimal
parameters for trading rules and portfolio allocation models. However, a
common limitation of these applications is the decoupling of the
optimization process from a realistic cost and risk model. The search is
often conducted in a simplified environment, with the resulting
parameters later proving fragile when subjected to real-world frictions.
This concern is closely related to classic data-snooping and
multiple-testing problems: repeated search over strategy variants or
hyperparameters can induce selection bias even when each backtest is
implemented correctly [sullivan1999datasnooping, white2000realitycheck, hansen2005spa, harvey2015crosssection]. Our use of DSR/PBO-style diagnostics
is therefore defensive and complements (rather than replaces) strict
execution and cost semantics [bailey2014deflated, bailey2017pbo].
Our framework contributes by integrating Bayesian optimization with a
realistic cost model from the first stage and by keeping strict
execution semantics fixed during Stage II screening. By framing the
problem in a signal-modular and execution-centric manner, we emphasize
the reusability of the pipeline itself, consistent with broader AutoML
principles [hutter2019automl].

### 3.4 Risk Management, Guards, and Full-Chain Consistency

A robust quantitative trading system requires more than a profitable signal; it
necessitates layers of risk management and validation that ensure
consistency from research to live deployment. The concept of risk-based
overlays or “guards” that monitor strategy performance and can
intervene to reduce or halt trading is a cornerstone of institutional
risk management practice. These systems often track metrics like
portfolio drawdown, volatility, or value-at-risk to make dynamic
decisions. Recent work on decentralized finance likewise emphasizes
protocol-level risk controls and auditable accounting mechanisms as
first-class design objectives [schar2021defi], reinforcing the view that
infrastructure and monitoring are integral components of robust decision
support and model governance.

A parallel concern is the “full-chain consistency” between the
backtest environment and the live execution engine. Divergences in data
handling, cost calculation, or order logic can invalidate backtest
results and lead to unexpected live performance [lopez2018advances].
Our work synthesizes these two concepts by proposing a framework that
not only includes a post-deployment live guard but also enforces a set
of accounting invariants across the entire backtest-to-live chain. This
provides a formal, auditable link between theoretical research and
practical implementation, a critical but often overlooked aspect of
financial data science.

## 4 Data and Market Setting

This section outlines the financial instruments, data sources, and
market assumptions that form the foundation of our empirical analysis.
We place a strong emphasis on data integrity and the realistic modeling
of trading costs, as these are critical prerequisites for robust
backtesting.

### 4.1 Instruments and Data Sources

The primary instrument for this study
is the BTC/USDT perpetual futures contract, and we report parallel
replications on ETH/USDT (large-cap) and SOL/USDT and AVAX/USDT (mid-cap)
perpetual contracts using the same STRICT4H family and evaluation scripts.
We utilize a comprehensive
dataset of 4-hour (4h) OHLCV bars sourced from major centralized
exchanges, with prices and volumes constructed from exchange-level
perpetual futures markets and cleaned using the procedures described
below. In the anonymized replication package this is implemented using
BTC/USDT perpetual data from Binance, Bybit, and OKX, as detailed in
Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). The dataset is partitioned into two segments: a Core
Sample (2019-09-08–2021-12-31, N=5,069N=5{,}069 4h returns) used for
descriptive statistics and for our core cost-accounting experiments, and
an Extended Long-Horizon Sample (2019-09-08–2025-10-14,
N=13,368N=13{,}368 4h returns) used for long-horizon diagnostics and
robustness stress tests. Crucially, our dataset includes a
synchronized time series of funding rates extracted at 8-hour intervals,
which we align to the 4-hour time axis as a step function (carried
forward between funding timestamps under a carry-forward alignment).
Where realized funding is unavailable for
a portion of the historical sample, we fall back to a conservative
constant funding-rate assumption from the same trading-cost profile.

For ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT, we use 4-hour OHLCV series and
corresponding 8-hour funding-rate series drawn from major exchanges.
Data availability differs by asset in our reproducible snapshot: the ETH
series spans 2021-12-31–2025-11-24, while the SOL/AVAX series spans
2021-01-01–2025-12-16. Our evaluation windows for the replications
begin on 2021-12-31 for all three assets (Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4 "4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")),
and we evaluate them under the same strict execution semantics and a
conservative cost family (asset-specific fee/slippage baselines plus the
cost-sensitivity grid described in Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")).

Table 10: Data summary for BTC/USDT 4-hour returns.

| Sample | # Returns (4h) | Mean Return | Std Dev | Min Return | Max Return |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core |  |  |  |  |  |
| (2019-09-08–2021-12-31) | 5,069 | 0.00043 | 0.01615 | -0.21046 | 0.14734 |
| Long |  |  |  |  |  |
| (2019-09-08–2025-10-14) | 13,368 | 0.00026 | 0.01309 | -0.21046 | 0.14734 |

In this manuscript, the label *core* refers specifically to the
BTC/USDT 4-hour segment used for the naive-versus-rigorous cost and
constraint stress test in Section 6.3 (2019-09-08–2021-12-31).
Separately, the BTC/USDT windowed experiments (baseline window
diagnostics and the one-stage versus two-stage comparison) use the
explicit training/validation splits that extend through 2023-01-01, and
long-horizon diagnostics extend through 2025-10-14. Table [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.T10 "Table 10 ‣ 4.1 Instruments and Data Sources ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")
reports descriptive statistics for the naive-versus-rigorous core segment
and the long-horizon segment.

Throughout the paper we use the following terminology for BTC/USDT 4-hour
windows (and analogous windows for the ETH/SOL/AVAX replications):

* 1.

  *Training window* (2019-09-08–2021-01-01): used exclusively
  for Stage I Bayesian optimization.
* 2.

  *Validation window* (2021-01-01–2023-01-01): used within the
  Stage II double-screening protocol for robustness checks and selection,
  but not for Stage I candidate generation.
* 3.

  *Long-horizon robustness window* (2019-09-08–2025-10-14): the extended
  series used for long-run diagnostics (including the deflated Sharpe
  calculation) and cost-stress tests, not for parameter
  selection.
* 4.

  *Blind post-ETF window* (2024-01-01–2025-10-14): a hold-out
  segment within the extended series that is never used for tuning or
  selection and serves solely for post-hoc robustness assessment.

For the ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT replications, we use an analogous
scheme with training (2021-12-31–2023-01-01), validation (2023-01-01–2024-01-01),
and a post-2024 hold-out starting 2024-01-01 (ending 2025-11-24 for ETH and
2025-12-16 for SOL/AVAX).

All Stage II thresholds and filters (Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")) are fixed *ex ante* prior to any evaluation on the long-horizon or blind hold-out windows, and we do not modify hyperparameters, thresholds, or selection rules after observing hold-out outcomes.

Table [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.T11 "Table 11 ‣ 4.1 Instruments and Data Sources ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") summarizes how these windows are reused (or held out) across Stage I optimization, Stage II screening, and post-hoc robustness checks.

Table 11: Mapping between evaluation stages and BTC/USDT 4-hour windows in the AutoQuant pipeline.

| Stage / component | Primary role | Windows used | Key settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stage I (Bayesian search) | Parameter generation | Training | TPE; Nopt=40N\_{\mathrm{opt}}=40 |
| Stage II (double-screening) | Robustness screening | Training + validation | K=5K=5; WFE win=2000, step=500 |
| Long-horizon diagnostics | DSR and cost stress | Long-horizon robustness | cost stress 2×2\times, 3×3\times |
| Blind evaluation | Post-ETF robustness | Blind post-ETF | post-hoc only |

When we refer to the *core sample*, we mean the 2019-09-08–2021-12-31
BTC/USDT 4-hour series described above, which is used for the
naive-versus-rigorous stress test in Section 6.3. For the windowed
results (baseline windows and one-stage versus two-stage comparisons),
we always use the explicit window names in the itemized definitions
above (Training, Validation, Long-horizon, and the blind hold-out window:
Post-ETF for BTC / Post-2024 for non-BTC) to avoid
ambiguity about date ranges and about which windows are held out from
Stage I.

Returns are computed as simple 4-hour arithmetic close-to-close returns,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | rtmkt=PtclosePt−1close−1r^{\mathrm{mkt}}\_{t}=\frac{P^{\mathrm{close}}\_{t}}{P^{\mathrm{close}}\_{t-1}}-1 |  | (9) |

where PtcloseP^{\mathrm{close}}\_{t} denotes the 4-hour close price. Under the STRICT4H execution semantics (Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")), the position applied to rtmktr^{\mathrm{mkt}}\_{t} is lagged by one bar, so that the raw strategy return at bar tt depends only on information available by the close of bar t−1t-1.

The unified codebase supports multiple time frequencies. For the results
reported in this manuscript, however, both Stage I tuning and Stage II
screening are reproduced from the standardized 4-hour (4h) OHLCV (Open,
High, Low, Close, Volume) series together with the aligned 8-hour funding
series under STRICT4H semantics; no auxiliary 1m/15m inputs are required
to regenerate the reported Stage I/II tables and figures. Separate
high-frequency guard experiments are described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and are not
part of the main empirical results.

### 4.2 Data Cleaning and Validation

Our policy for handling OHLCV data gaps is conservative and designed to
prevent the introduction of artificial price data. The system does not
perform interpolation or filling (such as forward-fill) of missing OHLCV
bars. Funding-rate timestamps are treated as a separate, external series:
when available, they are aligned to the 4-hour grid using carry-forward
between funding updates with no backfilling from future updates,
and when unavailable we fall back to a
conservative constant assumption from the cost profile.
We do not impute missing funding observations with zeros; missing values
are handled by carry-forward and the conservative fallback under the same
carry-forward semantics.
Where realized funding coverage is partial in historical samples, we
treat this fallback as a conservative approximation and quantify
sensitivity via the funding-multiplier cost scenarios used in Stage II.
Instead, a continuity check routine logs a warning for any detected gaps
and raises a data integrity exception if the number of missing bars
exceeds a predefined, minimal tolerance. For our core backtesting
datasets, this tolerance is typically set to zero, meaning any gap in
the OHLCV stream is treated as a fatal error, forcing a rejection of the
data source and halting the pipeline until the data is manually
corrected or replaced. This strict approach ensures that our backtests
are run only on clean, contiguous, and reliable historical data.

### 4.3 Data Construction Protocol (4-hour OHLCV)

To make the BTC/USDT 4-hour series auditable, we adopt a simple and explicit construction protocol: (i) use exchange-provided perpetual-futures candle fields (open,high,low,close,volume)(\mathrm{open},\mathrm{high},\mathrm{low},\mathrm{close},\mathrm{volume}) as the primary price/volume source (trade-price candles, not mark/index); (ii) represent each bar by its *bar-open* timestamp in UTC; (iii) enforce basic OHLCV sanity constraints (e.g., high≥max⁡(open,close,low)\mathrm{high}\geq\max(\mathrm{open},\mathrm{close},\mathrm{low}), low≤min⁡(open,close,high)\mathrm{low}\leq\min(\mathrm{open},\mathrm{close},\mathrm{high}), non-negative volume); (iv) sort, de-duplicate by timestamp, and run a strict continuity check at the target frequency; and (v) construct the STRICT4H funding series separately and join it as an external input with an explicit fallback when realized funding is unavailable.

In the unified codebase used for this manuscript, the data-fetch and merge logic is implemented in lightweight scripts that editors and reviewers can execute directly. For example, tools/fetch\_full\_history.py fetches Binance USD-M perpetual 1-minute candles and deterministically resamples them into 15-minute and 1-hour OHLCV; tools/gen\_4h\_from\_1h.py aggregates 1-hour bars into 4-hour OHLCV; and the continuity/validation checks are enforced via quant/data\_validators.py. For incremental updates (with provider fallback), tools/fetch\_klines\_incremental.py refreshes a target OHLCV file by paging K-lines from public endpoints and de-duplicating timestamps. For a one-command build/validate/report workflow, the repository snapshot also includes tools/build\_and\_pack\_4h.py, which orchestrates CI-style validators and report generation for the 4-hour dataset.

For the funding input, the repository snapshot includes tools/generate\_synthetic\_funding\_from\_ohlcv.py, which generates a deterministic 8-hour funding-rate baseline aligned to the OHLCV time range (used as a conservative fallback); when exchange-backed funding is available, we backfill it via tools/funding\_backfill\_from\_binance.py and align it to the STRICT4H grid using the carry-forward semantics described in Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

### 4.4 Trading Cost Model and Constraints

A cornerstone of our framework is
a realistic trading-cost model, which aims to provide a comprehensive
and conservative estimate of market frictions. The model is applied
uniformly across both backtesting and simulation stages to ensure
consistency. In our implementation this component is named RealisticTradingCosts. It incorporates the following components:

Trading Fees: Fees are applied when the position changes. In the
implementation, the fee cost on a bar is proportional to absolute
turnover, Cfee,t=|Δ​post|⋅feffC\_{\mathrm{fee},t}=|\Delta\mathrm{pos}\_{t}|\cdot f\_{\mathrm{eff}}, where fefff\_{\mathrm{eff}} is an effective fee rate.
While the model supports a maker/taker mixture, our STRICT4H case study
uses pure taker execution (maker ratio =0=0), so fefff\_{\mathrm{eff}}
reduces to the taker fee.

Slippage: Slippage is parameterized as a per-trade basis-point cost,
again applied to absolute turnover. In the implementation, Cslip,t=|Δ​post|⋅sC\_{\mathrm{slip},t}=|\Delta\mathrm{pos}\_{t}|\cdot s, with s=base​\_​slippage​\_​bps/10,000×slippage​\_​multipliers=\mathrm{base\\_slippage\\_bps}/10{,}000\times\mathrm{slippage\\_multiplier}.
Pessimistic scenarios scale the fee and slippage terms via higher
taker​\_​fee\mathrm{taker\\_fee} and base​\_​slippage​\_​bps\mathrm{base\\_slippage\\_bps}.

Funding Payments: Funding is charged on the signed nominal exposure
using an 8-hour funding rate series, scaled to the bar length. If
frt8​h\mathrm{fr}^{8h}\_{t} denotes the realized 8-hour funding rate aligned to
bar tt under a strict t+1t\!+\!1 convention (the rate observed at a
funding timestamp is applied only from the subsequent 4-hour bar onward),
the funding term is Cfund,t=post⋅frt8​h⋅(Δ​h/8)C\_{\mathrm{fund},t}=\mathrm{pos}\_{t}\cdot\mathrm{fr}^{8h}\_{t}\cdot(\Delta h/8), where Δ​h\Delta h is the bar
duration in hours. Importantly, all funding-dependent decision rules
(e.g., funding gates, biasing, and entry blocking) use only funding
information available at the bar close and never read future funding
rates.

In our BTC/USDT STRICT4H experiments, the baseline cost profile assumes an initial
equity of 10,000 USDT, a maximum leverage of 5×5\times, a notional cap of
50,000 USDT, a taker fee of 4 bps per trade, and a base slippage of
2 bps per trade. The cost profile also includes a fallback funding rate
of 1 bps per 8-hour period, but in the core experiments funding costs are
computed from the realized 8-hour funding-rate time series described
above (the fallback is used only if the series is unavailable).
For ETH/USDT STRICT4H aggressive we maintain the same
equity, leverage, and notional-cap assumptions but slightly increase
taker fees, funding rates, and base slippage relative to BTC. These
parameter choices are calibrated to be broadly consistent with fee
schedules and realized funding ranges on major centralized derivatives
exchanges over the 2019–2025 period, while remaining deliberately
conservative relative to the most favorable taker tiers. In particular,
we do not model maker rebates or aggressive fee discounts; our reported
results therefore err on the side of slightly overstating rather than
understating effective trading frictions for small- to mid-sized
positions.

Table [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.T12 "Table 12 ‣ 4.4 Trading Cost Model and Constraints ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") summarizes the baseline cost profile and
the stress scenarios used in the BTC/USDT STRICT4H case study.

Table 12: Cost-profile parameters used in the BTC/USDT STRICT4H experiments and stress scenarios. Fees and slippage are specified in basis points (bps). Funding uses the realized funding\_rate\_8h series when available, with a conservative fallback when the realized series is unavailable.

| Scenario | Equity | Lev. | Cap | Fee | Slip. | Funding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | 10,000 | 5 | 50,000 | 4 | 2 | real. + fb |
| Funding-off | 10,000 | 5 | 50,000 | 4 | 2 | off |
| Pess. (2×2\times) | 10,000 | 5 | 50,000 | 8 | 4 | real. + fb |
| Pess. (3×3\times) | 10,000 | 5 | 50,000 | 12 | 6 | real. + fb |

Leverage and Notional Caps: The backtest engine strictly enforces both
maximum leverage and absolute notional position caps. If a trade signal
would imply a resulting position that exceeds either of these limits,
the engine does not reject the trade. Instead, it caps the trade size,
automatically reducing the number of units to be traded so that the
final position adheres precisely to the most restrictive of the
configured limits. This ensures that the backtest never simulates a
position that would be impermissible in a live trading environment.

## 5 System Architecture and Implementation

This section summarizes implementation choices that are most relevant
to the auditability of our empirical results under strict execution and
cost modeling. The full AutoQuant codebase contains additional
production components (deployment utilities, exchange adapters, and
monitoring dashboards). In this manuscript we focus on the design
choices that bear directly on research validity: (i) reuse of the same
STRICT4H signal and cost engine across offline evaluation and live-style
replay; (ii) explicit, reconcilable accounting of returns and costs; and
(iii) a post-deployment guard that is intentionally separated from the
optimization objective.

### 5.1 Three Evaluation Stages: Data, Optimization, and Out-of-Sample Validation

The workflow is organized into three stages.
(i) *Data and environment validation* performs the integrity checks
in Section [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.SS2 "4.2 Data Cleaning and Validation ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and fixes a cost profile and constraint set that remain
unchanged during optimization and screening.
(ii) *Optimization and screening* implements the two-stage
methodology described in Sections [2.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS1 "2.1 Algorithmic Summary (Pseudo-code) ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")–[2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"): Stage I generates candidates
on a single training window under the realistic cost model, while
Stage II screens candidates across held-out evaluation windows and cost
stress scenarios using the STRICT4H engine.
(iii) *Live-style replay and risk control* applies the same
STRICT4H logic on a rolling window of recent data to produce a target
exposure and optionally overlays a guard for post-deployment risk
supervision. In this paper, Stage (iii) is treated as an auditability
pattern (consistency of signals and cash-flow accounting) rather than as
evidence of long-horizon live performance.

### 5.2 The Live Engine and Executor

The live engine is implemented as a thin wrapper around the same core
STRICT4H strategy and cost logic used offline. On each update cycle it
recomputes the target exposure from a bounded sliding window of recent
4-hour data and applies the same strict T+1 semantics described in
Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") (signals are produced at bar close and only take effect from
the next bar). The executor maps the target exposure to exchange orders
while enforcing the same leverage and notional caps used in the backtest
engine and logging all fills and cash-flow components (fees, slippage,
funding, and PnL) for subsequent reconciliation.

### 5.3 Guard and Monitoring Infrastructure

A live guard provides a post-deployment risk overlay that monitors a
dashboard of rolling performance and risk metrics computed from
execution logs and can issue an *ok/watch/kill* decision. A
“kill” decision triggers position flattening and can optionally
disable further trading until manual intervention. Because the guard is
triggered by realized PnL and risk states rather than by predictive
signals, we treat it as a safety mechanism that is conceptually
separated from the Stage I/II optimization objectives. In this paper we
report only limited offline and paper-trading evidence and therefore
interpret the guard component as an auditability pattern rather than as
a claim of live performance.

## 6 Empirical Evaluation

This section presents a series of empirical experiments designed to
evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed execution-centric auto-tuning
and validation framework. Using a multi-year dataset of BTC/USDT
perpetual futures, we aim to quantify the impact of common backtesting
pitfalls and demonstrate how our systematic, multi-stage approach
produces more robust and realistic performance assessments.

To align with ESWA-style component validation, we structure the empirical
section as a set of ablation-style diagnostics around the pipeline:
(i) one-stage tuning versus two-stage double-screening isolates the
incremental effect of policy-driven screening; (ii) a cost-ablation
ladder (fee-only versus fully costed versus zero-cost upper bound)
isolates the contribution of each friction channel; and (iii) an
execution-delay sanity check (t+1t\!+\!1 versus a deliberately naive
t+0t\!+\!0 convention) isolates the role of strict execution semantics.

### 6.1 Experimental Setup

Our experiments are conducted on 4-hour OHLCV
datasets for BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT perpetual contracts, built from the reproducible
core 4h dataset described in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4 "4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). This dataset covers the period
from 2019-09-08 to 2021-12-31 and contains 5,070 4h bars (5,069
non-overlapping 4h returns) after validation. For the primary
comparative experiment in Section [6.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.SS2 "6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), we supplement this core dataset
with the extended 4-hour BTC/USDT series described in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4 "4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and
define three distinct, non-overlapping (and for BTC deliberately non-contiguous) windows: an in-sample training
window from 2019-09-08 to 2021-01-01 used exclusively for Stage I
Bayesian optimization; a validation and selection window from 2021-01-01
to 2023-01-01 used within the Stage II double-screening protocol; and a
blind test window from 2024-01-01 to 2025-10-14 that is never used for
parameter tuning or selection and serves solely as a post-ETF hold-out
period for assessing robustness. For BTC, we intentionally leave the
2023-01-01–2024-01-01 interval unused to separate the validation-era
selection window from the post-ETF hold-out and to avoid hindsight-driven
recutting of the regime boundary. All backtests are executed using the
system architecture described in Section [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S5 "5 System Architecture and Implementation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), with costs modeled according
to the realistic trading-cost profile (Section [4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.SS4 "4.4 Trading Cost Model and Constraints ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")).
For ETH/USDT we mirror the study design with a training window
(2021-12-31–2023-01-01), validation window (2023-01-01–2024-01-01), and
post-2024 hold-out (2024-01-01–2025-11-24), using the same STRICT4H
configuration family and evaluation scripts.
For SOL/USDT and AVAX/USDT, we use the same training and validation window
definitions as ETH and extend the post-2024 hold-out through 2025-12-16.

Table 13: Configuration naming used in the manuscript. We distinguish *baseline* (a frozen reference from Stage I), *one-stage* (top-1 on training), and *two-stage* (selected via stable-candidate screening). “Naive” and “standard” are diagnostic stress-test variants applied to a separate stress-test configuration in Section 6.3.

| Name in text | Definition | Used for selection? | Where referenced |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline STRICT4H | Frozen reference built from top-ranked Stage I parameters; evaluated across windows | No | Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), Fig. [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4.3 Data Construction Protocol (4-hour OHLCV) ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") |
| One-stage (top-1) | Best Stage I trial by training-window objective | Yes (Stage I only) | Section [6.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.SS2 "6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") |
| Two-stage (selected) | Stable candidate selected by ex-ante filter and scenario-grid aggregation | Yes (Stage II) | Section [6.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.SS2 "6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") |
| Standard (fee-only) | Diagnostic backtest with taker fees only; same strict execution | No | Section [6.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.SS3 "6.3 Naive Backtest vs. Rigorous Backtest ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") |
| Naive (zero-cost) | Upper bound with fees/slippage/funding removed (and optional cap relaxation) | No | Section [6.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.SS3 "6.3 Naive Backtest vs. Rigorous Backtest ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") |

To provide a point of comparison, we define a Baseline Strategy
configuration. This is not a toy example but a realistic,
production-oriented baseline built from the top-ranked Stage I parameter
sets for our BTC/USDT STRICT4H family, and then frozen for all subsequent
window and stress-test evaluations. It serves as a fixed reference
configuration for auditing and ablation, using a mix
of standard indicator lookbacks (e.g., for trend and mean-reversion
signals) and conservative risk management rules, and is held fixed
throughout the experiments. Its performance over three windows is
summarized in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). For clarity, we distinguish three roles: (i) the
training window (2019-09-08–2021-01-01) serves as the primary optimization window for Stage I
Bayesian search; (ii) the validation window (2021-01-01–2023-01-01) serves as a validation-style
window that is held out from Stage I but explicitly reused within Stage II
double-screening; and (iii) the long-horizon window (2019-09-08–2025-10-14) is a stress
window that is used only for robustness checks (including the DSR
calculation), not for parameter selection.

Table 14: Baseline STRICT4H performance by window (BTC/USDT; annualized return reported as CAGR, %; window definitions follow Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4 "4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")). Values are taken from the replication outputs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

| Window | Ann. (CAGR, %) | MaxDD | Sharpe | Trades |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Long (2019-09-08–2025-10-14) | -24.09% | 0.9536 | -0.0738 | 4,814 |
| Training (2019-09-08–2021-01-01) | 16.59% | 0.6041 | 0.5233 | 1,027 |
| Validation (2021-01-01–2023-01-01) | -56.43% | 0.9174 | -0.5913 | 1,549 |

In keeping with our emphasis on interpretable and economically
meaningful performance metrics, Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") reports only normalized
statistics—annualized return, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and
total trade count—taken directly from the STRICT4H machine-readable outputs in our
replication package. The same outputs also contain raw total return
and final equity metrics, which we treat as internal accounting checks
and deliberately omit from the main text, as they are highly sensitive to
sample length and to the arbitrary choice of initial capital and are not
used as inputs to our statistical inference or robustness conclusions.

The performance of each experiment is evaluated using the set of metrics
defined in Section [2.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS2.SSS0.Px1 "Performance metrics. ‣ 2.2 The Signal-Modular Parameter Space ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") (with market returns defined in
Eq. ([9](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.E9 "In 4.1 Instruments and Data Sources ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"))). The Sharpe ratio, a key metric, is annualized
from the 4-hour returns using the annualization implied by the 4-hour
frequency (2190 4h bars per year) and assumes a constant annual risk-free
rate of 3%. Because 4-hour crypto returns are autocorrelated and heavy-tailed, we treat Sharpe as a descriptive statistic rather than as a parametric test. Our analysis focuses
not just on the absolute values of these metrics, but on their sensitivity
across different time periods and cost assumptions.

Reading guide for compounded return magnitudes.
Depending on the experiment, we report annualized return either as CAGR
in % (for readability) or as CAGR in decimal units (e.g., 0.10 = 10%).
In high-volatility regimes, compounded CAGR values can exceed 1.0 (i.e.,
exceed 100% per year) even under strict execution and explicit leverage
caps. We therefore interpret large CAGRs as *diagnostic* signals of
sensitivity to execution, window choice, and costs, and we emphasize
drawdown, stability across windows, and cost-stress outcomes. None of
the reported return magnitudes should be interpreted as statements about
institutional-scale deployability, since non-linear market impact is not
modeled.

### 6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening

The first experiment
is designed to test the core hypothesis of our paper: that a simple,
one-stage parameter optimization is insufficient for identifying robust
strategies. We compare two distinct approaches:

One-Stage Tuning: We run the Stage I Bayesian optimization exclusively
on the training window (2019-09-08–2021-01-01) to find the top-performing parameter
set based solely on its in-sample, cost-adjusted annualized return.

Two-Stage Framework: We take the pool of high-performing candidates from
Stage I and subject them to the full Stage II double-screening protocol,
including out-of-sample rolling window analysis and cost-mis-specification
scenarios. The final selected parameter set is the one that ranks
highest according to the stable-candidate criteria described in Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

To make this comparison concrete, we compute performance metrics on the
training window (2019-09-08–2021-01-01) and on the validation window (2021-01-01–2023-01-01) that is
out-of-sample with respect to Stage I, but still used within the Stage
II screening protocol. By construction, the simple one-stage tuning
procedure tends to identify parameter sets that look attractive on the
training window but degrade sharply when evaluated on the
validation window. In our audited BTC/USDT STRICT4H case study, the
baseline configuration—which is deliberately frozen after Stage I and
used as a reference point—illustrates this fragility. As shown in
Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), it attains 16.6% annualized return
with a maximum drawdown of about 60% on the training window, but then
degrades sharply on the validation window under the same cost and
execution model. These numbers are taken
directly from the STRICT4H walk-forward artifacts generated by our backtest
engine using the BTC/USDT datasets described in Section [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4 "4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). This
comparison illustrates why Stage II screening is required: under any
reasonable stability criteria, a configuration whose validation-window
return collapses and whose drawdown expands materially should be flagged
as fragile and treated as unsuitable for deployment without further
controls. We therefore interpret the validation-window results as a
validation-style robustness check rather than as a fully untouched,
final out-of-sample test, and we treat the Stage II protocol as a
mechanism for making such degradation visible and auditable rather than
as a guarantee of profitability.

Table 15: Direct comparison: one-stage versus two-stage selection under identical STRICT4H execution and rigorous costs (BTC/USDT). One-stage selects the single best Stage I trial on the training window. Two-stage selects a stable candidate via the ex-ante filter and cost-scenario aggregation described in Section [2.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS4 "2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). Validation is held out from Stage I but reused within Stage II screening; Post-ETF is a blind hold-out used only for robustness. To reduce the visual dominance of extreme compounded annualized returns in high-volatility regimes, we report the monthly geometric mean of net returns (decimal units; e.g., 0.10 = 10% per month) alongside Sharpe, drawdown, and trade counts. Annualized return figures remain available in the replication outputs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). Market impact and capacity constraints are not modeled. Buy-and-hold is included as a simple external yardstick (no trades) computed on the same OHLCV series.

Figure 3: Equity curves for one-stage (top-1) versus two-stage (selected) under rigorous costs on BTC/USDT. Curves start at 1.0 and are plotted over the training+validation period used in Table [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T15 "Table 15 ‣ 6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). The y-axis is log-scaled to avoid visual dominance by extreme compounding. The dotted vertical line marks the start of the validation window. The goal is diagnostic: the two-stage selection tends to reduce drawdown severity and extreme compounding relative to the top-1 in-sample winner, but it does not guarantee higher returns.

Interpretation relative to buy-and-hold.
Table [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T15 "Table 15 ‣ 6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") includes buy-and-hold as a simple
external yardstick for the underlying (no trades, no trading costs). In
the BTC post-ETF window, buy-and-hold outperforms both tuned STRICT4H
configurations on the reported risk-adjusted summaries. We interpret
this not as a contradiction but as a stress-test outcome that reinforces
our framing: the paper’s contribution is an auditable evaluation and
selection protocol under explicit execution and cost semantics, not a
claim that a fixed strategy family dominates a passive benchmark across
regimes.

Block-bootstrap check (validation window).
As a minimal inferential supplement that is robust to time dependence, we compute a moving block bootstrap [kunsch1989bootstrap] on the monthly return series for the validation segment, reporting a 95% interval for the difference in monthly geometric mean returns between the two-stage and one-stage procedures (two-stage minus one-stage).

Table 16: Moving block bootstrap CI for monthly geometric mean differences (BTC/USDT validation). Monthly geometric means are in decimal units; Δ\Delta is reported as two-stage minus one-stage.

| Window | Δ\Delta monthly geom (dec.) | 95% CI (dec.) | Block length (months) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Validation | -0.016 | [-0.040, 0.008] | 3 |

#### Threshold sensitivity.

Because stable-candidate selection relies on ex-ante thresholds
(Table [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T8 "Table 8 ‣ 2.4 Stage II: Rigorous 4h Backtest and Double Screening ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")), we report a sensitivity scan in
the replication package. Across reasonable variations of the monthly
return floor, drawdown cap, and switch-density cap, the selected trial
identity and its validation performance can change, highlighting that
these thresholds function as *risk-control design choices* rather
than as universal constants. We therefore treat the stable-candidate
filter as a transparent, auditable policy rather than as an optimized
meta-learner. In the 3×3×33\times 3\times 3 grid (27 policy variants), the selected configuration toggles among three trial IDs (52, 87, 108; each selected 9 times), with the number of passing candidates ranging from 12 to 31. Across these policy variants, validation-window CAGR spans 0.332–1.058 (decimal), Sharpe spans 0.844–1.667, and MaxDD spans 0.209–0.386. Table [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T17 "Table 17 ‣ Threshold sensitivity. ‣ 6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") shows representative settings.

Table 17: Representative threshold-sensitivity settings for stable-candidate selection (BTC/USDT). Thresholds are ex-ante design choices; we report the resulting selected trial ID and its validation performance under rigorous costs. Annual return is CAGR in decimal units; MaxDD is a fraction in [0,1][0,1].

| Monthly floor | MaxDD cap | Switch cap | Selected | Val CAGR (dec.) | Val Sharpe | Val MaxDD | Val trades |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.003 | 0.25 | 0.10 | 87 | 0.332 | 0.844 | 0.386 | 438 |
| 0.003 | 0.30 | 0.10 | 108 | 0.572 | 1.070 | 0.231 | 348 |
| 0.003 | 0.35 | 0.10 | 52 | 1.058 | 1.667 | 0.209 | 467 |

As an additional stress-test exercise, we keep selected configurations
fixed and extend them into the 2021-12-31–2025-10-14 BTC/USDT 4-hour
period (covering both the pre-ETF 2022–2023 segment and the post-ETF
segment after 2024), including a blind post-ETF hold-out window
(2024-01-01–2025-10-14). We treat these extensions as
post-hoc robustness checks rather than as headline results, and we do
not use them for parameter selection or for the core claims of the paper.
In particular, post-ETF performance can be highly regime-dependent; we
therefore emphasize the methodology (strict execution semantics, cost
modeling, and multi-window screening) and report post-ETF evaluations as
auxiliary stress tests in the replication package.

### 6.3 Naive Backtest vs. Rigorous Backtest

Our second experiment aims to
quantify the degree of performance overestimation that results from
extreme simplifications to the cost and constraint model. For this
purpose, we construct a deliberately optimistic “Naive” configuration
that holds the STRICT4H signal logic and T+1 execution semantics fixed
but removes market frictions and relaxes capacity constraints. Concretely,
relative to the rigorous configuration, the naive configuration (i) sets
fees, slippage, and funding costs to zero; and (ii) relaxes leverage and
notional caps so that the same signal path can be evaluated in a
near-frictionless environment. This should be interpreted as an upper
bound on friction- and constraint-related performance inflation in our
setting, rather than as a representation of typical industry
backtesting practice.

We next isolate the impact of cost modeling itself. For this purpose, we
take a separate STRICT4H configuration used specifically for this
stress test (it is not the baseline used in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"))
and evaluate it under a ladder of increasingly optimistic assumptions on
the BTC/USDT core sample (2019-09-08–2022-01-01, UTC; i.e., through 2021-12-31 under bar-open indexing). The *rigorous* variant uses the
full realistic trading-cost profile (fees, slippage, and funding) under
strict t+1t\!+\!1 execution. The *standard* variant keeps strict
execution but includes fees only. The *naive* variant removes fees,
slippage, and funding to form a zero-cost upper bound; we additionally test
a cap-relaxed version (leverage and notional caps relaxed), which does not
change the reported metrics in this snapshot. Because cost-aware channels
(e.g., funding-based gates) depend on the cost and funding inputs, the
realized trade sequence (and thus trade count) can differ across variants
even when hyperparameters are fixed.

Table 18: Cost ablation ladder for the naive-versus-rigorous stress test (BTC/USDT core sample). Fixed parameters; the realized trade sequence (and thus trade count) may differ across variants. Annual return is reported as CAGR in decimal units (e.g., 0.10 = 10%); values may exceed 1.0 under compounding and should be interpreted as a diagnostic of cost sensitivity rather than as a scalability claim. Market impact is not modeled. Values are taken from the replication outputs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

| Variant | Ann. (CAGR, dec.) | Sharpe | MaxDD | Trades |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rigorous (fees+slippage+funding) | 2.726 | 2.049 | 0.265 | 636 |
| Standard (fee-only) | 4.308 | 2.506 | 0.262 | 636 |
| Naive (zero-cost, upper bound) | 5.225 | 2.711 | 0.260 | 535 |

Table [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T18 "Table 18 ‣ 6.3 Naive Backtest vs. Rigorous Backtest ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") quantifies how optimistic cost simplifications
inflate reported performance for this fixed stress-test configuration.
Even a fee-only “standard” backtest can overstate performance relative to
a fully costed run that includes slippage and funding, and removing all costs
provides an additional optimistic upper bound. We treat these results as
diagnostic baselines rather than as evidence of scalable profitability, and
we do not interpret them as an AutoQuant-versus-standard uplift. The baseline
STRICT4H figures in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") correspond to a separate,
production-oriented parameter set and a different experiment.

### 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks

The final set of experiments evaluates the
robustness of the parameter sets identified by our full two-stage
framework under various alternative conditions, using data from the core
4-hour horizon and, where applicable, the extended sample.
First, to address the single-asset concern and to validate that the
workflow is not BTC-specific, we repeat the one-stage versus two-stage
comparison on ETH/USDT using the same STRICT4H family and identical
execution and cost semantics. Table [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T19 "Table 19 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") reports
the direct comparison. Similar to BTC, the two-stage selection does not
dominate the one-stage top-1 on annualized return but tends to select
more conservative configurations in terms of drawdown. We treat this as
evidence that the audit-oriented screening mechanism is portable at the pipeline level across
two liquid perpetual contracts, while emphasizing that it does not
establish universal profitability or transferability beyond these two
assets and this single strategy family.

Table 19: Direct comparison: one-stage versus two-stage selection under identical STRICT4H execution and rigorous costs (ETH/USDT). Windows mirror the ETH study design: training (2021-12-31–2023-01-01), validation (2023-01-01–2024-01-01), and a post-2024 hold-out (2024-01-01–2025-11-24) as a blind robustness segment. We report the monthly geometric mean of net returns (decimal units; e.g., 0.10 = 10% per month) alongside Sharpe, drawdown, and trade counts; annualized return figures remain available in the replication outputs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). Market impact and capacity constraints are not modeled. Values are taken from the replication outputs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

| Method | Window | Monthly geom (dec.) | Sharpe | MaxDD | Trades |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One-stage (top-1) | Training | 0.233 | 3.009 | 0.317 | 2112 |
| Two-stage (selected) | Training | 0.173 | 2.607 | 0.276 | 346 |
| One-stage (top-1) | Validation | 0.085 | 2.157 | 0.186 | 2012 |
| Two-stage (selected) | Validation | 0.046 | 1.368 | 0.201 | 457 |
| One-stage (top-1) | Post-2024 | 0.151 | 2.590 | 0.381 | 3880 |
| Two-stage (selected) | Post-2024 | 0.096 | 2.009 | 0.368 | 852 |

Second, to probe higher-friction mid-cap contracts, we repeat the same
protocol on SOL/USDT and AVAX/USDT using more conservative cost profiles
(higher fee and slippage assumptions) but the same strict execution
semantics. Table [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T20 "Table 20 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") reports the direct
comparison. The results illustrate the intended role of double-screening
as a *fragility filter*: the one-stage top-1 can exhibit extreme
compounding and large drawdowns, while the two-stage selection tends to
select more stable, lower-drawdown configurations under more conservative
cost assumptions. As with BTC and ETH, these results are diagnostic and do not
constitute a claim of scalable alpha.

Table 20: Direct comparison on mid-cap contracts under stricter cost profiles (SOL/USDT and AVAX/USDT). To avoid the visual dominance of extreme compounded CAGR values in small-sample, high-volatility regimes, we report the monthly geometric mean of net returns (decimal units; e.g., 0.10 = 10% per month) alongside Sharpe, drawdown, and trade counts. Annualized return figures remain available in the replication outputs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). Market impact and capacity constraints are not modeled.

| Asset | Method | Window | Monthly geom (dec.) | Sharpe | MaxDD | Trades |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SOL/USDT | One-stage (top-1) | Training | 0.141 | 2.625 | 0.319 | 1567 |
| SOL/USDT | Two-stage (selected) | Training | 0.124 | 3.013 | 0.152 | 1605 |
| SOL/USDT | One-stage (top-1) | Validation | 0.227 | 3.398 | 0.239 | 1596 |
| SOL/USDT | Two-stage (selected) | Validation | 0.362 | 4.208 | 0.242 | 1653 |
| SOL/USDT | One-stage (top-1) | Post-2024 | 0.066 | 1.747 | 0.243 | 3295 |
| SOL/USDT | Two-stage (selected) | Post-2024 | 0.068 | 2.301 | 0.195 | 3450 |
| AVAX/USDT | One-stage (top-1) | Training | 0.479 | 3.239 | 0.795 | 2063 |
| AVAX/USDT | Two-stage (selected) | Training | 0.091 | 4.856 | 0.055 | 1739 |
| AVAX/USDT | One-stage (top-1) | Validation | 0.572 | 3.851 | 0.621 | 1908 |
| AVAX/USDT | Two-stage (selected) | Validation | 0.087 | 4.185 | 0.096 | 1118 |
| AVAX/USDT | One-stage (top-1) | Post-2024 | 0.797 | 4.407 | 0.607 | 4158 |
| AVAX/USDT | Two-stage (selected) | Post-2024 | 0.094 | 3.994 | 0.142 | 3663 |

Third, to test portability beyond a single contract, we evaluate an
ETH-trained STRICT4H aggressive configuration on BTC/USDT over the
overlapping window (2021-12-31–2025-11-24, UTC). Table [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T21 "Table 21 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")
reports the key summary metrics under consistent rigorous trading-cost
profiles, and Figure [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") visualizes annual return and
maximum drawdown for the in-sample (ETH) and cross-asset (BTC) evaluations.

Table 21: ETH STRICT4H cross-asset performance (4h aggressive line) under consistent realistic trading-cost profiles for ETH and BTC over the overlapping data window (2021-12-31–2025-11-24, UTC; annual return is CAGR in %). Values are in percentage points (e.g., 0.44% corresponds to 0.0044 in decimal units). Values are taken from the replication outputs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

| Strategy | Train | Eval | Ann. (%) | MaxDD | Trades |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ETH STRICT4H aggressive v1 | ETH | ETH | 0.44% | 0.150 | 3,100 |
| ETH STRICT4H aggressive v1 | ETH | BTC | -0.17% | 0.089 | 3,403 |

![Refer to caption](figure3.png)


Figure 4: Cross-asset robustness of the ETH-trained STRICT4H aggressive configuration evaluated on ETH/USDT (in-sample) and BTC/USDT (cross-asset) over the overlapping data window (2021-12-31–2025-11-24, UTC; replication outputs in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")). Annual return is reported as CAGR in % (percentage points), and maximum drawdown is reported as a fraction in [0,1][0,1] in Table [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T21 "Table 21 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") but displayed in % for readability in this figure.

Fourth, we conduct a robustness analysis with respect to drawdown-aware
risk budgeting. We examine how the stable candidate’s annualized return
and Sharpe ratio change when exposure is scaled down in deeper drawdown
buckets under our baseline cost profile for the 2019-09-08–2025-10-14
BTC/USDT long window. This analysis illustrates the strategy’s tolerance
to extended drawdowns and clarifies that its edge does not rely on
maintaining full exposure during the worst episodes. Over the
2019-09-08–2025-10-14 long window, the drawdown-bucket risk-budgeting
variants improve annualized return by roughly 24–33 percentage points and
reduce maximum drawdown by about 14–26 percentage points relative to the
STRICT4H baseline (Table [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T22 "Table 22 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")).
These results support the view that simple, state-dependent exposure
scaling can materially improve risk/reward in a high-drawdown regime for
this BTC/USDT long-window analysis.

Table 22: Drawdown-bucket risk-budgeting variants vs the STRICT4H baseline on the 2019-09-08–2025-10-14 long window (annualized return reported as CAGR, %). Values are taken from the replication outputs described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

| Config | Ann. (%) | MaxDD | Sharpe | Δ\DeltaAnn. (pp) | Δ\DeltaMaxDD (pp) | Δ\DeltaSharpe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v1 (0–20–35) | 4.06% | 0.760 | 0.247 | 28.15 | -19.36 | 0.321 |
| v2 (0–18–33) | 0.37% | 0.810 | 0.194 | 24.46 | -14.32 | 0.268 |
| v3 (0–22–38) | 8.46% | 0.695 | 0.329 | 32.55 | -25.83 | 0.403 |

The shorthand labels v1–v3 correspond to the three drawdown-bucket
risk-budgeting policy variants summarized in Table [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T22 "Table 22 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

Here the differences are reported relative to the STRICT4H baseline over
the same 2019-09-08–2025-10-14 long window. Annualized return and maximum drawdown
differences are expressed in percentage points (pp), while Sharpe
differences are expressed in raw Sharpe units.

![Refer to caption](figure2.png)


Figure 5: STRICT4H baseline vs drawdown-bucket variants over the 2019-09-08–2025-10-14 BTC/USDT 4h long window: differences in annualized return (pp), maximum drawdown (pp), and Sharpe ratio (raw) versus the STRICT4H baseline.

Fifth, we assess the impact of cost mis-specification more directly on an
ETH STRICT4H aggressive configuration using the cost-sensitivity grid in
the ETH full-chain replication output (Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")). In this
grid we perturb the baseline cost assumptions (fee and funding multipliers
around the baseline profile) while holding the signal and STRICT4H
execution semantics fixed. Across plausible cost scenarios, annualized
returns and Sharpe can compress materially relative to the baseline,
underscoring that moderate underestimation of trading frictions can
distort conclusions about apparent profitability even when execution
semantics are held constant.

Finally, we briefly discuss the conceptual impact of the Live
Guard. While the guard’s actions do not alter the backtest results, its
logged “watch” and “kill” triggers from paper-trading deployments and
historical guard simulations help identify periods where the strategy’s
live performance begins to diverge from expectations set by the
STRICT4H backtests. These experiments provide qualitative, configuration-
specific insights into how the guard may function as a final layer of
risk control in practice, but they stop short of establishing a
long-horizon, production-level track record.

## 7 Discussion and Limitations

The framework presented in this paper offers a systematic approach to
mitigating common pitfalls in quantitative strategy
development for cryptocurrency perpetuals. By prioritizing
methodological rigor and end-to-end consistency, it shifts the focus
from the search for a “perfect alpha” to the process of identifying
more auditable and less fragile trading-system configurations. However, this
approach entails a series of trade-offs and is subject to several
important limitations.
At a conceptual level, our results support the view that, in
high-friction cryptocurrency perpetual markets, realistic execution
constraints and a double-screened auto-tuning pipeline are prerequisites
for producing auditable backtests, whereas naive one-stage tuning under
simplified costs can generate a substantial illusion of profitability.

At a higher level, our results can be interpreted as a practical
protocol for realistic auto-tuning of perpetual-futures strategies in
high-friction markets. In a typical deployment, a practitioner would (i)
validate data integrity and cost profiles; (ii) run a Bayesian search
under realistic costs on a primary window; (iii) subject the resulting
candidates to evaluation-window and cost-stress screening on
multiple windows that are held out from Stage I but reused within Stage
II; (iv) interpret the surviving configurations in light of
multiple-testing diagnostics such as the deflated Sharpe ratio; and (v)
enforce full-chain accounting invariants and live guard triggers during
paper-trading and production deployment. While our empirical analysis
concentrates on BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT, the protocol itself is deliberately formulated
at a higher level and could in principle be adapted to other derivative
markets with similar frictional structures.

Scope note: AutoQuant should be interpreted as an execution-aware configuration-selection and auditing system, not as a generative strategy-discovery engine. The inference step searches within a pre-specified signal family and can be viewed as a disciplined curve-fitting process; its value lies in making the fitting assumptions explicit (execution, costs, and window semantics) and in exporting auditable artifacts and invariants for governance. Research on grammar-based or evolutionary discovery of new trading rules is a separate direction and is left to future work.

### 7.1 Scope of the profitability illusion

The profitability illusions documented in this manuscript arise from
three concrete mechanisms within our BTC/USDT STRICT4H case study.
First, naive cost modeling can substantially overstate achievable
performance: Table [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T18 "Table 18 ‣ 6.3 Naive Backtest vs. Rigorous Backtest ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), based on a BTC/USDT STRICT4H
stress-test configuration on the core sample, shows that progressively removing
friction channels inflates annualized performance. In particular, the annualized
return increases from 2.726 (fully costed, fees+slippage+funding) to 4.308 under
fees-only, and to 5.225 under a zero-cost upper bound (all CAGR in decimal units).
These magnitudes are diagnostic and are not intended to be read as realistic,
capital-scalable outcomes for the production baseline in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). Second, treating a single evaluation
window as permanently “out-of-sample” obscures its role in parameter
selection. The comparisons in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), based on STRICT4H walk-forward
runs over the training window (2019-09-08–2021-01-01) and the validation window
(2021-01-01–2023-01-01), reveal that the validation segment simultaneously serves as a validation-style robustness check in
Stage II and as the source of performance numbers often reported as
out-of-sample, so we explicitly interpret it as a validation window
rather than as a fully untouched test set. Third, repeated parameter
search across many configurations and windows introduces
multiple-testing risk, which we address only partially through the
DSR-style sanity check discussed in Section [2.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.SS6 "2.6 Multiple-Testing Adjustment via Deflated Sharpe Ratio ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and through conservative interpretation of the empirical results.

Beyond methodological correctness, these mechanisms have practical
consequences: they can encourage overconfident capital allocation,
under-provisioned risk buffers, and brittle deployment of quantitative
components inside production decision-support systems. In high-friction
markets where limits to arbitrage are first-order, an explicit audit
trail that makes execution semantics, funding alignment, and window-reuse
rules observable is therefore not only a research convenience but also a
governance and risk-management requirement for auditable, rule-based
quantitative tooling.

As a result, the performance overestimation discussed in this paper should be
understood in a narrow, data-driven sense: it refers to the extent to
which BTC/USDT STRICT4H backtests can be inflated by optimistic cost
assumptions, by reusing a validation window as if it were strictly
out-of-sample, and by implicit multiple testing within our specific
AutoQuant pipeline. We do not claim to have exhaustively characterized
all sources of backtest illusion across asset classes, strategy
families, or modeling choices. Within this scope, the BTC/USDT STRICT4H
configuration provides the primary, fully audited evidence base, and we
also report parallel one-stage versus two-stage comparisons on ETH/USDT,
SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT under identical strict execution semantics
(Tables [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T15 "Table 15 ‣ 6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T19 "Table 19 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), and
[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T20 "Table 20 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")). Using the same accounting and execution
assumptions on assets with distinct volatility and funding dynamics, these
replications support pipeline-level portability across four liquid perpetual contracts,
but they do not constitute a full multi-asset validation of the framework
and do not imply that similar parameterizations will transfer to less
liquid assets.

A primary trade-off exists between the reusability of this
execution-centric framework and the potential for bespoke optimization.
By treating the signal engine as a black box, our system can be readily
applied to a wide variety of underlying strategy logics. The cost of
this generality
is that it may not achieve the same level of finely-tuned performance as
a pipeline designed monolithically around a single, specific alpha.
Furthermore, the robustness of the multi-stage validation process comes
at a significant computational cost. The extensive Bayesian search and
the numerous backtests required for the double-screening protocol are
resource-intensive, demanding substantial computational power and time.
This complexity also extends to maintenance; ensuring the integrity of
the full-chain invariants and the modular pipeline requires disciplined
engineering and careful logging infrastructure.

The framework’s effectiveness is also fundamentally dependent on the
quality of the underlying data. While our data validation module (Module
A) enforces strict continuity and integrity checks, it cannot correct
for latent flaws in the historical data provided by exchanges. The
“garbage in, garbage out” principle remains a central challenge, and
the system’s output is only as reliable as its inputs.

Finally, it is crucial to acknowledge the problem of model risk. Our
framework is designed to identify parameter sets that have been robust
to historical market conditions, but it does not, and cannot, eliminate
the risk of a fundamental structural break in the market. The Live Guard
mechanism serves as a reactive, last-line-of-defense against such
events, but its detection capabilities are performance- and
accounting-driven. At present, the guard does not perform explicit
statistical tests for real-time structural break detection (e.g., by
monitoring changes in market volatility or return distributions). It
detects regime changes only indirectly, via their impact on performance
metrics such as drawdown, rolling returns, or prolonged losing streaks.
A parameter set that was historically profitable may therefore still
fail if the underlying market dynamics change in a way that is not
immediately captured by these performance-based triggers.

An important statistical caveat concerns multiple-testing bias and
formal performance validation. The AutoQuant pipeline generates and
evaluates many candidate parameter sets, which raises the risk that some
apparently strong backtest results are artifacts of repeated trial-and-error.
As a complementary diagnostic (not a substitute for our walk-forward and
cost-stress evidence), we report a deflated Sharpe-ratio sanity check in
the spirit of [bailey2014deflated]. We treat each Stage II
configuration–window combination as one trial and compute a simple
closed-form DSR-style statistic from the observed long-window Sharpe and
an effective trial count (on the order of a few hundred to a few thousand
in our logs, around 360–3240 depending on whether the cost-scenario grid
is counted). In the current reproducible snapshot, the long-window Sharpe
is close to zero, and the DSR-style diagnostic does not provide strong
evidence against a zero-true-Sharpe null after accounting for multiple
trials. We therefore interpret the DSR-style statistic only as a
consistency check and place greater weight on the structural safeguards
provided by our multi-window screening and cost-stress experiments.
Complementing this DSR-style check, we report a CSCV/PBO-based diagnostic [bailey2017pbo]
computed on the Stage I candidate pool in our replication package. This
diagnostic estimates the probability that an apparent in-sample winner
fails to rank well out-of-sample across combinatorial train/test splits
of the monthly return series. In our reproducible BTC snapshot, the PBO
estimate is materially above zero, reinforcing that overfitting risk
remains substantial and that the manuscript’s primary contribution is
auditability and bias control rather than statistical proof of alpha.
The underlying numeric summary is exported as part of the replication artifacts described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures").

Our empirical analysis also distinguishes between pre- and post-ETF
periods through explicit windowing. The core BTC/USDT 4-hour sample
(2019-09-08–2021-12-31) anchors our descriptive statistics and the
naive-versus-rigorous cost inflation experiment. The extended long series
(2019-09-08–2025-10-14) is used to define the training and validation
windows in Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), to compute long-horizon
diagnostics such as the deflated Sharpe-ratio statistic, and to run
post-ETF hold-out experiments in which we extend a small number of
pre-selected parameter sets to the 2024–2025 blind window without any
additional re-optimization. As a result, the performance levels in our
main tables should be interpreted as pertaining primarily to the
training/validation-era experiments, while the long-horizon and post-ETF
windows serve as additional stress tests rather than as a fully re-tuned,
post-ETF validation.

### 7.2 Limitations

Our study is subject to several specific limitations that point toward
avenues for future research:

Limited Asset Coverage: The empirical evaluation in this paper focuses
on four liquid perpetual contracts (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT)
within a single STRICT4H strategy family. While these are significant
instruments, the framework’s performance and the specific parameter sets
identified may not generalize directly to other, less liquid crypto
assets with different volatility and cost profiles.
Contract lifecycle and survivorship: We restrict attention to large, continuously traded perpetuals on major venues in our reproducible snapshot. We do not systematically study delistings, symbol migrations, or exchange-specific contract re-specifications, which can introduce survivorship and data-availability biases in broader cross-sectional studies; we therefore do not claim portability of the reported parameterizations to newly listed, discontinued, or thinly traded contracts.
While the long-horizon diagnostics span multiple market regimes, we do
not separately isolate black-swan event windows (e.g., LUNA/FTX-style
episodes) as dedicated stress tests in the main text and leave such
event-conditioned analyses to future work.

External Benchmarks Under Identical Semantics: While we contrast one-stage
and two-stage selection, include buy-and-hold as a simple yardstick, and
provide cost- and window-based stress tests, we do not report a full
end-to-end benchmark against third-party backtesting or AutoML toolkits
under identical strict execution and funding-alignment semantics. Many
off-the-shelf frameworks can be configured to approximate realistic costs,
but subtle differences in timestamp alignment, funding availability
conventions, and execution semantics can dominate results in perpetual
markets. As a minimal external audit, we include a third-party semantics
replay that reproduces our strict close-to-close, t+1t\!+\!1 raw-return
accounting in Backtrader (Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")). A fair, full external benchmark
of end-to-end pipelines would still require re-implementing STRICT4H-style
invariants and the same data-validation protocol inside each baseline,
which we leave to future work.

Optimizer baselines: Although we justify TPE as a practical sampler for
conditional mixed search spaces, our optimizer evidence is intentionally
limited. We report a minimal baseline comparison of TPE versus random
sampling under a matched strict-backtest evaluation budget (Table [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S2.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Why TPE (and why not grid / evolutionary / GP-BO)? ‣ 2.3 Stage I: Bayesian Auto-Tuning under Realistic Costs ‣ 2 Methodology: Execution-Centric Auto-Tuning and Double Screening ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")),
but we do not provide a broader head-to-head study against evolutionary
methods or other Bayesian samplers. We therefore frame the contribution as
the execution- and auditability-preserving pipeline (strict semantics,
cost realism, and policy-driven screening) rather than as a claim that TPE
is uniquely optimal for this setting.

Data-Construction Disclosure: Section 4.2 documents our core OHLCV
construction protocol (UTC bar-open indexing, sanity filtering,
de-duplication, and continuity validation) and points to the scripts used
to rebuild long-window 4-hour candles and funding baselines. Nevertheless,
several exchange-specific data-construction choices can still matter in
perpetual markets (e.g., whether a venue’s OHLCV reflects last-trade,
mark, or index pricing; cross-venue aggregation rules; and handling of
contract-specification changes). These details are implemented in the
replication code and configuration templates and remain a natural target
for a dedicated data-pipeline audit in future work.

Linear Cost Model and Position Scaling The cost profile we use in the
STRICT4H experiments assumes an initial capital of 10,000 USDT, a
maximum leverage of 5×5\times, and a notional cap of 50,000 USDT, consistent
with the baseline cost assumptions described in Section [4.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S4.SS4 "4.4 Trading Cost Model and Constraints ‣ 4 Data and Market Setting ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). The
reported annualized returns and Sharpe ratios should therefore be
interpreted as describing the behaviour of small- to mid-sized positions
in a frictional but non-impact world. In particular, we do not model
non-linear market impact or exchange-specific liquidity constraints, so
we do not claim that the same percentage returns would be attainable at
institutional asset levels (for example, 10 million USD or more).
Consistent with this view, we treat the very large final-equity figures
that arise in long synthetic compounding runs in our simulation logs and
machine-readable exports as accounting artifacts, and we deliberately omit them from
the main tables so as not to suggest unrealistic capital scalability.
More broadly, our cost model is linear in turnover and does not capture
non-linear impact (e.g., the empirical square-root law of market impact;
see [almgren2000optimal, toth2011anomalous, gatheral2010no]);
incorporating impact-aware execution models is an important direction for
future work, especially for less liquid assets or larger AUM settings.
All data and code required to reproduce the reported results are
organized within the unified codebase and the anonymized replication
materials described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"), which we provide to editors,
reviewers, and qualified researchers on reasonable request, subject to
the data-access constraints discussed above.

Alpha Logic Constraints: While the framework is signal-modular at the
architectural level, integrating highly complex, non-parametric machine
learning models (e.g., deep neural networks) would require additional
engineering. While the backtest engine can readily consume signals from
a pre-trained model at inference time, the current auto-tuning pipeline
is not designed to manage the separate training, validation, and GPU
resource management loops required by such models, and the empirical
evidence in this paper is limited to a STRICT4H momentum-style family on
BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT.
Relatedly, automated *candidate generation* (e.g., factor-library
composition, template expansion, or genetic programming / symbolic
regression that proposes new functional forms) is outside the scope of
this manuscript. Such generators can be integrated as upstream modules,
but their outputs should be evaluated under the same strict t+1t\!+\!1
semantics, cost modeling, and multi-window screening used here.

## 8 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we introduced a systematic framework for the auto-tuning
and multi-stage validation of quantitative strategies for cryptocurrency
perpetual futures. We demonstrated, with BTC/USDT as an audited anchor
case study and with replications on ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT,
that common backtesting practices which neglect realistic costs or are
prone to look-ahead bias can lead to a material overestimation of
strategy performance. Our primary contribution is a structured,
two-stage selection pipeline (Stage I search + Stage II screening)
complemented by a post-deployment layer of monitoring and risk
management. Concretely, the pipeline combines Bayesian optimization under
realistic cost models, a rigorous “double-screening” protocol using
held-out and cost-stress scenarios, and a live-style audit/guard overlay.

Our empirical results on multi-year data across the four contracts
indicate that, in this specific high-friction setting, enforcing
realistic execution and costs
can materially change candidate rankings and reveal degradation on a
held-out validation window, as evidenced by the comparisons in
Table [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T14 "Table 14 ‣ 6.1 Experimental Setup ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and Section [6.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.SS2 "6.2 One-Stage Tuning vs. Two-Stage Double Screening ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). The ETH results in
Tables [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T19 "Table 19 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") and [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#S6.T20 "Table 20 ‣ 6.4 Robustness and Sensitivity Checks ‣ 6 Empirical Evaluation ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures")
provide a four-asset replication (as a pipeline-level portability check) of the one-stage versus two-stage
comparison under identical strict execution semantics (with more
conservative cost profiles for mid-caps), but they should not be
interpreted as a broad multi-asset validation beyond these four assets.
By enforcing full-chain accounting invariants and
employing a live guard mechanism, the framework aims to provide a
practical and auditable pathway from research to live execution within
this asset class. We view this as a design objective supported by
preliminary offline and paper-trading evidence rather than as a guarantee that
live performance will match backtests; realized results remain subject
to model risk, structural breaks, and implementation constraints.

From an expert-systems and decision-support perspective, the practical implication is
that quantitative evidence in 24/7 derivatives markets should be
delivered as an *auditable artifact*: a complete specification of
timestamp conventions, execution semantics, cost and funding alignment,
and window-reuse rules, together with deterministic scripts that
regenerate the reported tables and figures. To support this auditability
goal, our Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") includes both internal full-chain consistency checks
and minimal external semantics replays.

Managerial implications.
For practitioners building algorithmic trading or risk-control pipelines
in 24/7 derivatives markets, our evidence supports a set of concrete
governance practices: (i) treat execution semantics and funding alignment
as non-negotiable policies rather than as optional backtest settings; (ii)
pre-register window semantics and selection rules to avoid hidden reuse of
validation segments; (iii) maintain deterministic, per-run artifacts
(signals, exposures, and cost decompositions) to enable independent
audits; and (iv) deploy lightweight guard overlays that monitor invariant
violations and reconcile offline and live-style replays.

Finally, we stress that all numeric results reported in the tables and figures can
be exactly reproduced from the unified codebase and the anonymized
replication materials described in Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1 "Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures"). These materials bundle
cleaned 4-hour OHLCV and funding-rate series where redistribution is
permitted, together with scripts that re-download and rebuild the cleaned
series when redistribution is restricted; they also include walk-forward
result tables, configuration files, and execution scripts with step-by-step
instructions, allowing qualified researchers to reproduce the backtests
and validation procedures reported here, subject to the data-access
constraints discussed above.

## Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools

We place a strong emphasis on reproducibility and transparency. All
experiments in this paper were conducted using a single, unified
codebase that implements the backtest engine, Bayesian optimization
pipeline, double-screening protocol, and live guard logic described
above. For this manuscript we maintain an anonymized replication
package, built from this codebase, that provides the core 4-hour datasets
(and/or scripts to regenerate them), configuration files, and scripts needed to reproduce
the reported backtests, validation procedures, and tables. This package
is shared with editors, reviewers, and qualified researchers on
reasonable request, subject to exchange data-licensing and storage
constraints. The numeric results shown in the main text are generated
directly from simulation outputs to ensure consistency between the
manuscript and the underlying experiment logs.

For the core tables and figures in this manuscript, the replication
package includes deterministic scripts that regenerate the machine-readable outputs
used to produce the tables and figures. The replication package contains a brief README
that lists the exact commands and expected output filenames for each
table and figure, together with brief notes on input data and runtime.
For transparency, the replication package also includes a small script
that regenerates the figures included in this LaTeX submission.

Example commands (Windows, local venv).

py scripts\paper_assets\make_figures.py
py tools\gen_4h_from_1h.py
py tools\generate_synthetic_funding_from_ohlcv.py
```

This repository snapshot includes derived machine-readable artifacts under
reports/paper/ that are used to generate the tables and figures. End-to-end regeneration
scripts for all tables (and optional third-party semantics replays) are
provided in the companion replication package described above; because
full-chain logs can be large, this snapshot includes the derived artifacts
used in the manuscript.

Table 23: Minimal audit artifacts exported by AutoQuant. Each run exports machine-readable files that allow independent regeneration of tables/figures and reconciliation of net returns into raw-return and cost components. Exact filenames and schemas are documented in the replication README.

Execution-semantics sanity check. As an additional
minimal audit that can be reproduced from the repository snapshot, we
report how performance changes when the same 4-hour strategy parameters
are evaluated under strict t+1t\!+\!1 execution versus a deliberately
naive same-bar (t+0t\!+\!0) execution convention. This is a semantic
sensitivity check only; it is not presented as a realistic trading
assumption and is not used for parameter selection. Values in
Table [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.22476v1#A1.T24 "Table 24 ‣ Appendix A Reproducibility, Code, Data, and AI Tools ‣ AutoQuant: An Auditable Expert-System Framework for Execution-Constrained Auto-Tuning in Cryptocurrency Perpetual Futures") are generated from the replication artifacts described above.

Table 24: Execution-semantics sanity check (BTC/USDT 4h; 2022-01-01–2023-01-01). Fixed parameters; only the execution delay differs: strict t+1t\!+\!1 versus same-bar t+0t\!+\!0. Annual return is CAGR in decimal units; monthly geometric mean is in decimal units; MaxDD is a fraction in [0,1][0,1].

| Semantics | Ann. (CAGR, dec.) | Monthly geom (dec.) | Sharpe | MaxDD | Trades |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| STRICT (t+1t\!+\!1) | -0.221 | -0.021 | -2.413 | 0.221 | 30 |
| NAIVE (t+0t\!+\!0) | -0.264 | -0.025 | -2.998 | 0.264 | 28 |

Batch semantics uplift (Stage I top-NN). To avoid
over-interpreting a single parameter setting, we also report a batch
summary over the top-NN Stage I trials: we re-evaluate each trial on the
same hold-out window under STRICT t+1t\!+\!1 versus NAIVE t+0t\!+\!0, keeping
all other settings fixed. This batch audit quantifies whether t+0t\!+\!0
execution *systematically* inflates performance in our snapshot.
For BTC/USDT on 2022-01-01–2023-01-01 using the top N=30N{=}30 Stage I
trials, the median uplift (NAIVE minus STRICT) in annualized return is
negative and the fraction of trials with positive uplift is below 50%,
indicating that naive same-bar execution does not act as a universal
performance booster in this setting. The batch outputs are generated
by a deterministic helper script included in the companion replication package.

Table 25: Batch execution-semantics uplift (BTC/USDT 4h; 2022-01-01–2023-01-01; top N=30N{=}30 Stage I trials). Uplift is NAIVE(t+0t\!+\!0) minus STRICT(t+1t\!+\!1) in annualized return (CAGR, decimal units).

| NN | Median uplift | 25th pct | 75th pct | % uplift >0>0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30 | -0.018 | -0.361 | 0.033 | 0.367 |

Third-party semantics replay (Backtrader). As a minimal
external audit of our strict close-to-close t+1t\!+\!1 execution
accounting (raw returns only; no costs), we replay the same directional
signal series in the Backtrader engine under cheat-on-close execution
and compare the resulting per-bar return series to the vectorized
STRICT4H raw-return construction. On BTC/USDT 4h over 2022-01-01–2023-01-01,
the maximum absolute per-bar difference is on the order of 10−610^{-6} and
the correlation is effectively 1.0, supporting the claim that the paper’s
strict raw-return semantics are not an artifact of a single bespoke
implementation. Outputs are generated by
a deterministic helper script included in the companion replication package.

Table 26: Backtrader raw-return replay check (BTC/USDT 4h; 2022-01-01–2023-01-01). Raw returns only; costs and funding disabled for this semantics-only audit.

| Bars | Max |Δ||\Delta| | RMSE | Corr. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2190 | 2.75×10−62.75\times 10^{-6} | 2.94×10−72.94\times 10^{-7} | 1.000 |

The historical BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/USDT, and AVAX/USDT perpetual data
used in this study were obtained from major centralized exchanges
(primarily Binance, Bybit, and OKX). Due to exchange licensing and
storage constraints, we do not redistribute raw tick-level data. The
replication materials include scripts and configuration templates that
allow qualified researchers to re-download data from original sources
(subject to exchange terms) and to regenerate the cleaned 4-hour OHLCV
and funding-rate series used in our experiments. For example,
tools/fetch\_klines\_incremental.py rebuilds 4-hour OHLCV;
tools/funding\_backfill\_from\_binance.py backfills exchange
funding; and tools/generate\_synthetic\_funding\_from\_ohlcv.py
provides a deterministic funding baseline aligned to the STRICT4H grid.
Processed summary statistics and anonymized walk-forward tables can be
shared with editors and reviewers on reasonable request during peer
review.

High-frequency guard experiments. As part of our broader research agenda
we conducted a series of high-frequency ATR-guard experiments on 1m–60m
resampled BTC/USDT data; these auxiliary experiments are not part of the
main empirical results reported in this paper.
These experiments applied ATR-based stop and take-profit rules on
intraday bars on top of the STRICT4H baseline. Empirically, none of the
tested configurations delivered a clear improvement in risk-adjusted
performance once realistic fees and slippage were taken into account;
most settings either left performance essentially unchanged or degraded
it by introducing noise-induced turnover. We therefore interpret these
results as context-specific evidence that, in the high-friction cost
regime considered here, a 4-hour decision horizon is more suitable than
naive 1m–15m overlays, while recognizing that more sophisticated
high-frequency designs remain an open avenue for future work.

During the preparation of this manuscript, we used OpenAI Codex CLI (model: GPT-5.2) in a limited, assistive capacity for English copy-editing and tightening of non-technical prose, and for drafting internal checklists for reproducibility and table/figure traceability. After using this tool, we reviewed and edited the content as needed and take full responsibility for the content of the published article. All experimental results, numerical findings, and conclusions reported in this manuscript were generated and verified solely by the authors using the described codebase and exported artifacts.
