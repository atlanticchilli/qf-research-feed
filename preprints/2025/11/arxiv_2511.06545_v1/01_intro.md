###### Abstract

The rapid diffusion of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has substantially lowered the costs of launching and developing digital ventures. GenAI can potentially both enable previously unviable entrepreneurial ideas by lowering resource needs and improve the performance of existing ventures. We explore how founders’ technical and managerial expertise shapes GenAI’s impact on digital ventures along these dimensions. Exploiting exogenous variation in GenAI usage across venture categories and the timing of its broad availability for software tasks (e.g., GitHub Copilot’s public release and subsequent GenAI tools), we find that the number of new venture launches increased and the median time to launch decreased significantly more in categories with relatively high GenAI usage. GenAI’s effect on new launches is larger for founders without managerial experience or education, while its effect on venture capital (VC) funding likelihood is stronger for founders with technical experience or education. Overall, our results suggest that GenAI expands access to digital entrepreneurship for founders lacking managerial expertise and enhances venture performance among technical founders.

## Introduction

In late 2022, the public launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT made large language models (LLMs) easy to access for common users. Since then, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has gained rapid adoption through an increasing variety of features, tools, and platforms built on top of these LLMs. GenAI has the potential to transform knowledge work across a variety of domains, due to its ability to generate text and images and perform cognitive and creative tasks on par with humans. In knowledge work involving software coding, professionals have especially embraced GenAI features such as code generation and code completion and have increasingly integrated them into development workflows. It is estimated that by the end of 2024, about 10-30% of open-source Python code in North America, Europe, and Asia had been generated by AI \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(daniotti2025using)\@BBCP, and this share has continued to rise to date. Meanwhile, drastic cost reductions enabled by LLMs in a variety of knowledge tasks have opened up a window of market opportunities \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(shane2000promise; ramoglou2024opportunity)\@BBCP, captured by firms introducing new GenAI features and products to serve the needs of different customer segments, many of which acquired users rapidly. Rapid GenAI diffusion can potentially have large effects on how entrepreneurs build digital ventures, for which software tasks are crucial to product development and customer acquisition.

While prior research shows that GenAI can increase individuals’ efficiency in completing standalone tasks \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(peng2023impact; cui2025effects)\@BBCP, less is known about its broader impact on organizational outcomes in real-world professional settings, where GenAI capabilities and human expertise are combined to drive strategic decisions and implement work tasks. In particular, founders’ technical and managerial expertis – both crucial forms of human capital for digital ventures \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(schulz2025ceo)\@BBCP – may shape the impact of GenAI adoption on venture outcomes. The consequences of GenAI usage in digital venture development may be particularly salient, given the widespread adoption and rapid progress of GenAI capabilities, especially for conducting software tasks. While GenAI’s wide adoption may change the role of different types of human expertise in contributing to organizational activities, empirical evidence on how these shifts occur remains limited. This paper addresses these research gaps by exploring the following research questions: How does GenAI affect access to entrepreneurship and subsequent venture performance across venture categories? Can different types of founder expertise, especially technical and managerial expertise, become sources of competitive advantage for digital ventures using GenAI?

The immediate consequence of GenAI-driven automation is a reduction in the resource needs and financial costs of entrepreneurial activities that involve software development tasks. This is driven not just by a single tool but by a variety of LLMs and GenAI coding features built on top of these LLMs, with different interface designs that suit the needs of developers from diverse backgrounds. GenAI may affect digital entrepreneurship through two channels: (1) reducing the resource needs and increasing the economic viability of implementing potential venture ideas; and (2) enhancing the productivity and accelerating product development and user acquisition for current ventures.

The effects of GenAI usage are likely uneven across existing expertise in the founding team, since humans operate GenAI to co-create solutions in many different ways. Ventures’ ability to sustain a competitive advantage from GenAI usage may depend on human-AI collaboration, especially on founders’ ability to engage with AI systems effectively \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(csaszar2025unbounding; hasan2025model)\@BBCP. On the one hand, GenAI may enable founders with technical expertise to delegate lower-level tasks to GenAI and focus on higher-level and architectural tasks that require specialist domain knowledge \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(cui2025effects)\@BBCP. Since GenAI features for coding are largely trained on publicly available software code, they perform much more reliably in retrieving and recombining shallow knowledge than deep domain knowledge. Hence, GenAI capabilities may complement experienced developers and technical experts in performing complex engineering tasks, who may especially gain from GenAI by accelerating their workflows. On the other hand, GenAI capabilities may mimic and more easily replace managerial expertise, which is essential to running a digital venture. GenAI has been shown to bridge the distance between different domains and blend knowledge from across fields when coming up with solutions \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(dell2025cybernetic)\@BBCP. This capability mirrors how managers synthesize information across functions to make strategic decisions, which requires a generalist perspective and a holistic understanding of different domains, but not a deep understanding of each specific domain. Therefore, we propose that founders’ lack of managerial expertise should be associated with larger effects of GenAI on viability, while their technical expertise should be associated with larger effects of GenAI on venture performance.

To conduct empirical analyses, we use data from Product Hunt, a large online platform where entrepreneurial teams launch digital products to acquire early users and test market traction. Identifying each venture by its unique website domain, we collect data on all first-time public launches of new ventures, including information about the founding team, the product itself, and initial user traction on the platform. We augment these data by obtaining information about the underlying venture from PitchBook and the primary founder from Revelio. Our identification approach leverages the exogenous variation in the extent to which GenAI usage is prevalent across venture categories. By defining a dichotomous indicator of high (versus low) GenAI usage at the category level, we use a difference-in-differences regression model to estimate the impact of GenAI on entrepreneurial access and venture performance in two sets of empirical analyses. In each set of analyses, we explore the moderating effects of the technical and managerial expertise of the primary founder, using separate measures constructed from prior work experience and education.

The first set of empirical analyses shows that 42% more initial venture launches take place in treated (relative to control) categories, driven by reduced product development time and lower financial costs that improve the viability of venture ideas. Though these results are broadly present across founders from a variety of demographic groups, younger and college-educated founders appear to respond disproportionately to GenAI availability, consistent with recent empirical evidence that these demographic groups also show overall higher GenAI adoption across populations \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(humlum2025unequal; bick2025impact; daniotti2025using)\@BBCP. We find that the treatment effects on launches by founders without managerial expertise (i.e., having worked in a managerial occupation in their last job, or having a master’s or higher degree in business-related fields) were twice as high as those on launches by founders with managerial expertise, and the differences between the coefficient estimates are significantly significant at the 1% level using both measures of managerial expertise. In contrast, we do not find founders’ technical expertise (i.e., having worked in a computer occupation in their last job, or having a bachelor’s or higher degree in STEM fields) to contribute to significantly different treatment effects between ventures.

The second set of empirical analyses shows that GenAI has a close-to-zero and statistically insignificant effect on ventures’ likelihood of raising venture capital (VC) funding – an important milestone that indicates the venture’s scaling potential – after accounting for venture and founding team characteristics as well as launch year-quarter fixed effects. However, the primary founder’s technical experience has a large positive moderating effect, which indicates that ventures experience improved chances of raising VC funding due to GenAI exposure if their founders come from technical and non-managerial backgrounds. Similarly, we also find a significantly positive moderating effect of founders’ higher education degrees in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field, but no significant moderating effect of an MBA or similar advanced degree in a business field.

Our theoretical and empirical results broadly suggest that GenAI usage contributes to both improved access to entrepreneurship and the potential for enhancing venture performance. However, founders’ technical and managerial expertise constitute boundary conditions for when new digital ventures may gain from GenAI usage. These findings add to the nascent literature on the impact of generative AI on entrepreneurship \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(bao2025generative; asamgenerative; otis2024uneven)\@BBCP, by clarifying access and performance as two distinct mechanisms through which GenAI channels efficiency gains for potential digital entrepreneurs. We examine how founders’ technical and managerial expertise – conceptualized from the perspective of specialist and generalist knowledge \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(kaplan2015double; teodoridis2019creativity)\@BBCP that vary in their susceptibility to complementarity or substitution by GenAI – may determine whether digital ventures can derive a competitive advantage from GenAI usage \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(csaszar2025unbounding)\@BBCP. Finally, we contribute to recent research on how GenAI changes the productivity of performing knowledge tasks \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(peng2023impact; cui2025effects; brynjolfsson2025generative)\@BBCP, by analyzing changes in digital ventures’ viability and performance due to a wide range of GenAI tools as well as practices for incorporating them in the entrepreneurial process, which go beyond the effects of a single product (e.g., GitHub Copilot) at the individual level for performing a fixed task.

## Theory and Background

### Generative AI and Digital Venture Development

Advances in artificial intelligence technologies have disrupted market equilibrium and introduced new entrepreneurial opportunities \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(shane2000promise; ramoglou2024opportunity)\@BBCP. While previous AI technologies excelled at pattern recognition and prediction \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(agrawal2022prediction)\@BBCP, recent advances in deep learning have unleashed even more powerful capabilities that mimic humans’ ability to understand text and images \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(grimes2023scarcity)\@BBCP. Powered by the transformer architecture \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(holmstrom2024organizations; vaswani2017attention)\@BBCP and trained using massive computing power on vast amounts of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) have marked a significant breakthrough in the field of AI \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(eloundou2024gpts)\@BBCP. GenAI systems built on top of large language models (LLMs) can respond to users’ prompts in real time and generate high-quality text, images, and audio.

Generative AI is considered a general-purpose technology \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(bresnahan1995gpt; goldfarb2023could)\@BBCP due to its broad applicability and impact on many sectors. The adoption of LLMs and GenAI systems has spread more rapidly than that of the personal computer and the Internet \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(humlum2025unequal; bick2025impact)\@BBCP. For example, ChatGPT accumulated over one million users within five days of its first release in November 2022 \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(holmstrom2024organizations)\@BBCP, and currently has over 6 billion monthly visits and over 700 million active weekly users as of mid-2025. Not only can GenAI systems automate mundane tasks, but they also demonstrate superior capabilities in carrying out certain complex knowledge tasks that demonstrate human-level intelligence and creativity. Due to GenAI’s superior performance relative to humans in precision, speed, and consistency, it may raise the productivity of knowledge workers across a variety of professional tasks, including customer service \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(brynjolfsson2025generative)\@BBCP, management consulting \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(dell2023navigating)\@BBCP, writing \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(noy2023experimental)\@BBCP, and software development \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(peng2023impact; cui2025effects)\@BBCP.

Software development has been among the earliest and swiftest fields to adopt GenAI, as the industry embraced its capabilities to generate high-quality software code (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4.1) in response to natural language prompts. Since mid-2022, a variety of GenAI coding agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor) and GenAI-powered low-code platforms (e.g., Replit, Lovable) have emerged to serve the specialized needs of software development tasks across diverse contexts. By early 2025, GitHub Copilot had reached over 20 million users worldwide. As the founder of Y Combinator and venture capital investor Paul Graham put it: “A friend in the AI business estimated that the price/performance of AI had decreased by about 100x in each of the past 2 years. 10,000x in 2 years. I don’t think any technology has improved so fast in my lifetime… I ask all the software companies I meet about this (the percentage of code that’s now written by AI). The number is rarely lower than 40%. For some young programmers it’s 90%.” According to research that detects AI-generated Python functions in open-source code, the amount of AI-generated code spiked following the release of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, and has continued to rise over time, reaching close to 30% of open-source Python code in the United States by the end of 2024 \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(daniotti2025using)\@BBCP. As GenAI reaches widespread adoption among software developers performing real work, it may fundamentally transform how developers handle software tasks, and eventually the digital products and services built on software.

The digital sector’s quest to automate software development workflows long predated the rise of GenAI. Since the early 2010s, a variety of low-code tools that let users build web apps through “drag-and-drop” have emerged and gained popularity among digital entrepreneurs. A notable example is Shopify, which provides a suite of low-code solutions that enable e-commerce entrepreneurs to create digital storefronts and operate their ventures while writing little to no software code themselves \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(dushnitsky2021low)\@BBCP. However, these tools have several limitations, especially for experienced technical users, due to their lack of customization and flexibility \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(bruhl2023nocode)\@BBCP. They only allow users to deploy pre-built templates and workflows, without modifying the underlying code to implement specific features or business logic. Moreover, users of these tools can neither inspect nor own the source code, nor migrate the codebase out of the low-code platform for further development.

In contrast, GenAI overcomes these limitations of traditional low-code tools because of its capabilities to adapt outputs (i.e., software code) in response to users’ prompts in real time. Users can exert full control over the codebase and modify the code to suit their specific needs using natural language prompts, which facilitates debugging, scaling, and integration much more conveniently than traditional low-code tools. It allows not only non-technical users to generate a codebase without writing code, but also technical founders to speed up software development workflows. Hence, GenAI may both reduce the need for new digital ventures to hire dedicated software developers and allow technical founders to build, test, and pivot their ideas faster at the same time.

Among the earliest GenAI-powered coding tools is GitHub Copilot, which was publicly released in late June 2022 (after a one-year technical preview), and became widely adopted soon after. GitHub Copilot directly embeds GenAI in the software development environment, serving as a “pair programmer” with code generation and code completion functionalities. Shortly afterward, in September 2022, Replit – a cloud-based coding platform that enables developers to create entire web apps in the browser – launched Replit Ghostwriter with AI coding functionalities highly similar to GitHub Copilot. Both GitHub Copilot and Replit became widely popular with growing user bases that exceeded 30 million worldwide in early 2025, and they are far from the only GenAI software companies with large customer bases. Since 2023, a variety of GenAI coding assistants and platforms have been launched, tailored to different software expertise levels (e.g., non-coder vs. software engineer), development lifecycle stages (e.g., prototyping vs. full launch), and software deployment environments (e.g., local vs. cloud). For example, GenAI-native coding editors such as Cursor and Codeium (later rebranded as Windsurf) target experienced software developers as their core market segment, directly embedding code generation and suggestion capabilities into the local integrated development environment. On the other hand, GenAI-powered low-code platforms like Replit and Lovable target less technical developers, allowing users to generate entire codebases for full-stack web apps from scratch in their browsers by describing the features they want without the need to write any code. These tools commonly rely on application programming interface (API) calls to large language models (LLMs) that excel at generating software code, such as Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4.1. Many of these AI coding startups rapidly gained market traction by making software development more accessible and more efficient across a variety of expertise levels and industry contexts. The market for GenAI coding tools is currently in rapid evolution, as the rising demand drives the creation of new tools by innovative startups entering the market to meet underserved needs across different market niches. Appendix Table [A1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#A1.T1 "Table A1 ‣ Appendix A Additional Tables and Figures ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") lists all the major launches of GenAI coding platforms, tools, and features powered by LLMs up to the end of 2024.

Instead of being locked into one tool, digital entrepreneurs often combine a variety of GenAI tools or features for different purposes at various stages of building their ventures. Low-code GenAI platforms are useful for initial prototyping and quick experimentation, where entrepreneurs favor the speed of co-creating functional websites and prompting additional features with these tools, aimed at quickly launching minimum viable products (MVPs) to gauge potential market demand. However, the rapid code generation through these platforms can be a double-edged sword: technical debt accumulates at the same time as rapid generation of product features, which can severely constrain maintainability as initially simple prototypes grow into highly complex codebases. While entrepreneurs may begin product development on low-code platforms, they often need to migrate the codebase elsewhere after hitting capability limits, when the costs of modifying generated code or correcting technical errors outweigh the benefits of rapid codebase generation. As the venture grows, entrepreneurs may increasingly prioritize the ability to customize and own the codebase, and thus transition to using integrated development environments such as Visual Studio Code and Cursor (which can natively embed GenAI coding features) to continue developing locally. This often occurs when the venture faces scaling constraints, when the rapid growth of the userbase makes it necessary to optimize website performance, which requires solid engineering practices (e.g., refactoring the codebase) controlled by human developers. Another trigger for migrating the codebase out of the initial low-code platform or launchpad is often related to security or compliance requirements, when entrepreneurs need more control over their infrastructure, e.g., storing data in a private database to ensure security and owning the development environment instead of relying on a public cloud and third-party platforms.

### Impact of Generative AI on Entrepreneurial Access and Performance

As GenAI speeds up software development workflows, it can both lower costs and improve productivity in carrying out entrepreneurial tasks. By reducing resource requirements for product development, GenAI can improve the feasibility of business ideas that were previously too costly to implement and expand entrepreneurial access to founders with lower financial resources. For example, ventures targeting niche markets may now be viable, whereas previously the cost-benefit calculus may have discouraged entrepreneurs due to the anticipated difficulty of achieving break-even profitability. On the other hand, GenAI can also improve venture performance by increasing efficiency in conducting various software tasks throughout the entrepreneurial process. For example, GenAI may enhance venture quality through faster user feedback loops and more iterative product development and experimentation.

However, the wide availability of GenAI may erode its potential to provide a sustainable source of competitive advantage for entrepreneurial firms, because the technology itself is cheap to access and easy to acquire across the board \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(csaszar2025unbounding; barney2001resource)\@BBCP. Often, a human in the loop is required for co-creating solutions with GenAI across various tasks in venture development, and human judgment remains crucial for the performance of the human-AI system overall \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(raisch2025combining)\@BBCP. For example, developers need to decide what prompt to enter as input for GenAI coding tools and how to edit the software code output by these tools. Hence, founders’ expertise in various domains may lead to heterogeneous ways of incorporating GenAI into the entrepreneurial process, some more effective than others at improving venture outcomes. The resource-based view explains a firm’s competitive advantage through its internal capabilities and resources, rather than external conditions such as widespread GenAI adoption. Firms with complementary resources, such as skilled workers who understand how to operate the technology to co-create solutions, are more effective at sustaining their competitive advantage from embracing technological innovation \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(tambe2014big; wu2020data; goldfarb2023could)\@BBCP.

GenAI may lead to differential gains for ventures, depending on both the founders’ existing expertise and GenAI’s uneven capabilities in conducting knowledge work. GenAI may automate cognitively tedious but intellectually mundane tasks \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(lichtinger2025generative)\@BBCP, similarly to how technological innovations have historically replaced workers performing routine, codifiable tasks while augmenting those working on more complex tasks \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(autor2003skill)\@BBCP. While LLMs demonstrate surface-level understanding of a vast range of knowledge domains, they lack deep understanding of domain-specific knowledge and the complex reasoning required for most knowledge tasks beyond the entry level. Recent empirical evidence shows that companies have slowed the hiring of junior roles, but senior roles are unaffected \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(brynjolfsson2025canaries; lichtinger2025generative)\@BBCP, consistent with the strengths and limitations of GenAI in relation to different real-world knowledge tasks.

LLMs that power GenAI coding tools are trained on publicly available software code, which tends to embody generic and shallow expertise that is broadly accessible and lags behind frontier practice. Knowledge is much more accessible to the public at a lower level, thus providing LLMs with more training data to replicate the expertise related to such knowledge and replace humans with similar expertise. LLMs may make it easier and less costly to access and combine relatively shallow knowledge across vastly different domains. Similar to data analytics \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(wu2020data)\@BBCP, which broadens the information search space across existing knowledge, GenAI can also quickly grasp a vast amount of data across a wide range of domains to retrieve and combine knowledge from these domains more rapidly than humans. However, LLMs lack depth in local search and face a disadvantage relative to domain experts in acquiring domain-specific knowledge required for non-incremental innovation. Hence, the expertise of specialists \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(kaplan2015double; teodoridis2019creativity)\@BBCP who possess rarer domain knowledge may be less substitutable by GenAI compared to the expertise of generalists who possess shallow knowledge across a larger number of domains. Specialists’ deep domain expertise is less likely to be replicated by GenAI, and their ability to innovate and learn at the frontier of a knowledge domain, which has not yet become codified or entered training data, makes them more likely to sustain such an advantage over LLMs over time. Hence, GenAI is more likely to replace human expertise relevant for performing generalist tasks involving the combination of shallow knowledge from broader domains, and to complement human expertise relevant for performing specialist tasks involving domain-specific and relatively rare knowledge crucial for innovation.

In digital ventures, founders with different types of expertise using GenAI may yield systematically different gains from GenAI. Founding teams often have co-founders with complementary skills and combine their distinct expertise as technical and business co-founders. However, GenAI may shift the balance between technical and managerial expertise in performing key activities throughout the entrepreneurial process of an early-stage venture. Technical expertise is often specialist and focused on a narrow domain with greater depth \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(ferreira2012gets)\@BBCP, whereas managerial expertise is often generalist and requires spanning the boundaries of domains and effectively combining information from across these diverse domains to make strategic decisions that require relatively shallow understanding of each domain \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(grant1996toward)\@BBCP. Since access to shallow knowledge across diverse domains has become less costly due to GenAI, managerial expertise may become more easily available and thus less valuable. On the other hand, technical expertise may become more valuable because it cannot be readily replaced by GenAI and embodies deep knowledge that enables individuals to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation within the domain \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(teodoridis2019creativity)\@BBCP. Therefore, both entrepreneurial access and performance gains from GenAI for coding may be larger among those potential founders with more technical expertise and less managerial expertise. While the former can more easily co-create effective outputs with GenAI, the latter face lower barriers to acquiring necessary business knowledge to operate their ventures.

### Measuring Digital Venture Launches: Product Hunt

To examine how GenAI affects the launch and performance of nascent digital ventures, we collect large-scale data from Product Hunt, a global online platform where startups conduct initial public launches to acquire early adopters and gain market traction. Product Hunt was founded as an online community for surfacing new technology products, where individuals share new discoveries of technology products on the platform. The platform soon became popular among tech entrepreneurs and early adopters, and is frequently used by early-stage ventures to conduct initial launches to gauge signals of market traction, acquire early users, and validate their ideas \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(cao2024sampling)\@BBCP. Currently, Product Hunt has about four million monthly visits and half a million active users, many of whom participate on the platform using their real names and professional profiles that can be linked to other data sources.

Product Hunt is an appropriate setting for the study because the impact of GenAI coding on digital entrepreneurship is most salient at the early stage, where entrepreneurs have a business idea and launch a working product or prototype to test the market. At this stage, GenAI may alleviate resource barriers for potential entrepreneurs most effectively because it helps speed up the development of the product itself. Instead of relying on popular databases (such as CrunchBase or PitchBook) or government records of registered businesses, our approach allows us to observe potential ventures at the beginning of the entrepreneurial lifecycle, when they are about to launch with a concrete business idea, but possibly do not yet have a formal organizational entity attached to it yet.

We collect rich data from the platform, including detailed information about ventures’ product launches and their founding teams (tagged as “makers” on the launch posts). Since we focus on first-time launches close to a venture’s creation, we use the primary founder’s information (tagged as the lead maker) to construct founder variables for the venture. For each launch, we obtain the website domain (which uniquely identifies the underlying venture222The only exceptions are mobile apps, Chrome extensions, and Google Workspace products, which do not have standalone websites. All other launches in the data are uniquely linked to a distinct website domain.) and a single venture category associated with the initial launch. For the primary founder, we observe their number of followers on Product Hunt, name, headline, and social links, which allow us to match the individual with external data and obtain more information about demographics, career history, and educational background.

## Empirical Framework

### Data

We collect comprehensive data from the Product Hunt platform on digital ventures’ first-time public launches and the founders of these ventures. We augment the data by matching it to external databases on both ventures and founders, which are described as follows. We leave the details of the data construction steps to the Data Appendix.333Available upon request or for peer-review purposes.

Revelio. Revelio Labs provides a comprehensive workforce database by aggregating hundreds of millions of public employment records into structured formats. It contains cleaned and processed data from the universe of LinkedIn profiles covering over 1.1 billion individuals and over 20 million companies. It also consolidates job titles, educational degrees, and fields into standardized categories. Using individual-level job and education history, we derive variables for founders’ demographics, work experience, and educational background.

CrunchBase. CrunchBase is a large-scale commercial database that provides detailed structured data on companies and prominent individuals (e.g., founders, executives, board members, and investors) involved in technology entrepreneurship. It has particularly comprehensive coverage of private venture-backed startups founded since the late 2000s and based in the United States \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(den2017using)\@BBCP. The key datasets we use from CrunchBase are the organization profiles, people profiles, and employer-employee-linked job profiles. From the organization profiles, we obtain each firm’s founding date and operating status. From the people and jobs profiles, we obtain founders’ names, present and past employers, and social links (including Twitter and LinkedIn). Linkage between CrunchBase and other data sources is enabled by several variables, including companies’ website domain as well as individuals’ names and social links.

PitchBook. PitchBook is a leading data source on global capital markets, which provides particularly granular data on startups and growth-stage private firms that have raised private equity, venture capital, or angel funding. We obtain a company’s funding rounds (if any) and other information, through matching based on the company’s website domain.

### Sample and Descriptive Statistics

The empirical analyses focus on first launches of ventures during the time period from 2020Q1 to 2025Q2. Since the study focuses on early-stage digital ventures, we apply the following criteria to ensure that the final data sample consists of new digital ventures that launched their first working product publicly on Product Hunt. First, we remove launches without a maker, since these are unlikely to be intentionally planned launches by the founders (and are instead hunter-initiated discoveries of existing products). Second, we focus on entrepreneurial product launches by removing podcast episodes, games, and books, as well as products without standalone website domains that are complementors hosted on third-party platforms (e.g., design templates, Amazon sellers). Third, we remove observations with more than 30 launch posts, because they are likely to be mature software companies launching many tools. Fourth, we remove website domains created more than six years prior to their first launch on Product Hunt, since they are unlikely to be early-stage ventures. Fifth, to ensure sufficient information about the primary founder’s professional background is available, we retain only ventures whose primary founder’s LinkedIn profile (obtained through Revelio) indicates at least one company in their work experience. Finally, we restrict the sample to those ventures where the primary founder’s location is in North America, Europe, or Asia, which together account for 88% of the remaining ventures, because both LinkedIn and PitchBook coverage of founders and ventures at the population level falls sharply outside these continents. See the details of these sample selection criteria in Appendix Section [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#A2 "Appendix B Sampling Criteria and Final Data ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures").

The final dataset contains 59,642 distinct launches, for which we consolidate information about their underlying ventures and founders to derive key variables for empirical analyses. In Appendix Section [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#A3 "Appendix C Description of Variables in Empirical Analyses ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), we list all the key variables for empirical analyses, and explain how each variable is defined and constructed in the final sample of ventures. Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") presents summary statistics for these variables in the final dataset at the venture level.

### Empirical Strategy

Our empirical analyses aim to uncover the treatment effects of GenAI usage for coding on digital ventures. The ideal experiment for conducting such empirical analyses would involve observing two otherwise identical potential entrepreneurs with the same business idea for a digital venture, and granting one of them access to GenAI but not the other, and then comparing their GenAI usage as well as outcomes such as launching and fundraising. This hypothetical experiment would allow the researcher to estimate causal treatment effects because any differences in outcomes would be entirely attributable to GenAI access, with all other factors held constant.

However, such an ideal experiment that randomizes access to GenAI is not feasible in our setting. Founders can choose from different GenAI coding tools, all of which are widely accessible at relatively low costs. We do not observe which GenAI features potential entrepreneurs use or how intensively they engage with these features. As low-code platforms are often launchpads rather than permanent homes for production-grade software products, entrepreneurs will likely have migrated away from the platform-hosted domain they may have initially used, at a later stage of the venture’s lifecycle. Unlike early generations of low-code platforms, such as Shopify, which can be detected using web technology tracking databases like BuiltWith, the usage of GenAI for coding often leaves no obvious digital footprint in ventures’ website tech stacks. Even if the websites generated by certain tools may use default designs that share common technology components initially, developers often change the design and customize the website for further development.

Instead, because the usage and value-add of GenAI are not equal across all types of ventures, we can leverage exogenous variation in overall GenAI usage across product categories to estimate causal effects using a difference-in-differences regression framework. We take this approach because technology adoption is driven by perceived cost-benefit tradeoffs \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(hall2004innovation)\@BBCP, and thus GenAI adoption should be higher when ventures conduct activities in which the use of GenAI raises efficiency to a larger extent, after accounting for financial and cognitive costs of using GenAI. Therefore, despite being widely accessible at low costs, GenAI capabilities are uneven across tasks and problem domains, and thus the extent to which GenAI lowers resource needs or enhances the productivity of various development activities may vary across venture characteristics. Hence, our empirical strategy relies on exogenous differences in GenAI usage across venture categories, driven by varying degrees of benefits from GenAI adoption.

We describe several reasons that may explain systematic variation in the degrees of GenAI usage across venture categories as follows. First, different types of ventures involve different levels of software development needs. For example, some ventures (e.g., consultancy firms) may only need a landing page showing the address and contact information for customers to reach them, while their primary activities are conducted offline. Some ventures may build physical products and require advanced technologies beyond software coding, such as hardware, the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR). Second, ventures in certain categories entail more complex technical requirements than others and therefore face higher technical barriers to entry. For example, GenAI capabilities are much more effective at handling front-end software tasks, for which publicly available code is overrepresented in training data, compared to back-end tasks, which require complex reasoning about architecture design, data modeling, and business logic. In addition, front-end tasks are also easier because the outputs are immediately visualized, and users can fix the code by describing the changes they want to make to GenAI, whereas the quality of the back-end code is much more hidden and harder to detect. Hence, GenAI alone is likely insufficient for building products that require technically complex back-end logic, optimizing performance when deploying to large-scale user bases, and implementing proper data security measures, or solving other complex engineering issues. Third, some types of ventures are relatively “low-tech” (e.g., fashion e-commerce), where more founders may come from less technical backgrounds and find low-code solutions more useful for building their offerings. GenAI may lower resource barriers, especially for these entrepreneurs, and is therefore more widely used to create prototypes and implement ideas by entrepreneurs in these “low-tech” categories.

To obtain a systematic measure of GenAI usage intensity at the venture category level, we calculate G​e​n​A​I​U​s​a​g​eGenAIUsage as the ratio of the number of product launches on third-party website builder platforms to the total number of launches in each category from 2021 to the end of the sample period. This measurement approach is enabled by the fact that websites built on various popular GenAI website builders often retain subdomains of these builder platforms. GenAI involvement should be much higher for these websites compared to those with their own standalone domains.

From a variety of information sources, we identify modern web app builder platforms that either have low-code features or emphasize rapid deployment – both of which enable users to build and publish entire websites quickly. We then find all launched products explicitly built natively on these platforms, indicated by not their having own custom domain but still being hosted on these platforms’ subdomains (e.g., [\*.replit.app](*.replit.app), [\*.framer.ai](*.framer.ai)). 444Appendix Figure [A1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#A1.F1 "Figure A1 ‣ Appendix A Additional Tables and Figures ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") plots the quarterly counts of such products launched on Product Hunt since 2021Q1, which reveal that the number of such hosted products tripled in late 2022 before plateauing, and skyrocketed again in early 2024 through the present. The rate of growth of such products was much faster than the growth in the total number of products launched on Product Hunt. This is consistent with the rising impact of GenAI coding tools on the overall launch of digital products since the advent of large language models (LLMs) with GPT-4-level capabilities. We then divide the number of such third-party-hosted applications by the total number of launched products in each category since 2021, to account for differences in baseline prevalence among categories. This gives us the scaled G​e​n​A​I​U​s​a​g​eGenAIUsage measure for each venture category as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | G​e​n​A​I​U​s​a​g​ec=#​L​a​u​n​c​h​e​s​O​n​B​u​i​l​d​e​r​P​l​a​t​f​o​r​m​sc#​L​a​u​n​c​h​e​s​T​o​t​a​lcGenAIUsage\_{c}=\frac{\#LaunchesOnBuilderPlatforms\_{c}}{\#LaunchesTotal\_{c}} |  | (1) |

We restrict the categories included in the sample to those with at least 100 launches between January 2021 and June 2025 (the end of the sample period), so that the number of launches in each category is not zero in most year-quarters. This sample restriction results in 85 categories, which together account for 96% of all product launches on the platform. We then dichotomize the G​e​n​A​I​U​s​a​g​eGenAIUsage measure into a binary treatment status variable, which equals 11 when G​e​n​A​I​U​s​a​g​eGenAIUsage is above the median across categories and 0 otherwise. This definition results in exactly 42 treated categories and 43 control categories.

Our empirical strategy involves a difference-in-differences regression framework to estimate the causal effects of GenAI for coding on several outcomes, where we use 2022Q3 as the period when treatment started, when the first cohort of influential GenAI-powered coding assistants began to gain widespread traction. The most widely adopted among these early tools was GitHub Copilot, which was publicly released in late June 2022. However, quite a few other GenAI coding assistants and platforms also launched, and website builder platforms added GenAI features shortly after (e.g., Replit’s Ghostwriter in September 2022 and Codeium’s beta launch in October 2022). Appendix Table [A1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#A1.T1 "Table A1 ‣ Appendix A Additional Tables and Figures ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") shows the launch timeline of all such tools or features by major AI coding editors and AI coding platforms. Many of these GenAI features, assistants, and platforms also gained rapid adoption soon after their launch. Therefore, our estimation framework focuses on GenAI for coding in general, rather than on the launch of GitHub Copilot specifically, as in most prior research using a similar research design.

### Research Design

In this section, we describe the research design in more detail. We outline two sets of empirical analyses on the impact of GenAI on ventures’ first-time launches and longer-run performance, respectively.

#### 3.4.1 Effects on Entrepreneurial Access: Quarterly Panel of Product Categories

The first set of empirical analyses relies on a sample consisting of a category-level balanced panel running quarterly from 2020Q1 to 2025Q2. The underlying data are the observations summarized in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), aggregated to the level of the category-year-quarter by counting the number of ventures satisfying different conditions and launching for the first time. We leverage the systematic variation in GenAI usage across venture categories to define treated and control groups for causal identification (see Section [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.SS3 "Empirical Strategy ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") for details).

To estimate the causal impact of GenAI for coding on category-level statistics for first-time launches of ventures in the sample, we use a difference-in-differences regression framework, specified in Equation [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.E2 "In 3.4.1 Effects on Entrepreneurial Access: Quarterly Panel of Product Categories ‣ Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") below.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | L​a​u​n​c​h​S​t​a​t​sc​t=β​P​o​s​tt×T​r​e​a​t​e​dc+ξc+ηt+ϵc​tLaunchStats\_{ct}=\beta Post\_{t}\times Treated\_{c}+\xi\_{c}+\eta\_{t}+\epsilon\_{ct} |  | (2) |

The outcome L​a​u​n​c​h​S​t​a​t​sLaunchStats is an aggregated variable at the level of the focal category cc in year-quarter tt. We focus on two statistics, both log-transformed by taking the natural logarithm after adding one: (1) the number of first-time launches by different types of founders; and (2) the median number of months to first-time launch after website became operational. P​o​s​tPost is equal to 1 if the year-quarter tt is 2022Q3 or after, and 0 otherwise. The regression controls for category fixed effects ξ\xi and time fixed effects η\eta. Robust standard errors are clustered at the category level, since treatment is defined at this level. The coefficient β\beta estimates the treatment effect of GenAI for coding on treated categories (for which T​r​e​a​t​e​d=1Treated=1) relative to control categories (T​r​e​a​t​e​d=0Treated=0). We also estimate an event study variant of Equation [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.E2 "In 3.4.1 Effects on Entrepreneurial Access: Quarterly Panel of Product Categories ‣ Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), in which separate coefficients are estimated for every year-quarter, allowing us to assess the validity of the parallel trends assumption \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(bertrand2004much)\@BBCP and visualize the timing of the treatment effect across year-quarters.

#### 3.4.2 Effects on Venture Performance: Venture-Level Sample

The second set of empirical analyses relies on a sample consisting of venture-level observations, summarized in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), for which time to launch is non-missing. To estimate the causal impact of GenAI for coding on venture performance, we use the regression specification in Equation [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.E3 "In 3.4.2 Effects on Venture Performance: Venture-Level Sample ‣ Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") below, which models heterogeneity across founders with different types of expertise prior to launching their ventures.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | F​u​n​d​e​di​c​t=γ0​P​o​s​tt×T​r​e​a​t​e​dc+γ1​P​o​s​tt×T​r​e​a​t​e​dc×F​o​u​n​d​e​r​E​x​p​e​r​t​i​s​ei+Xi​t+ψc+ϕt+νc​tFunded\_{ict}=\gamma\_{0}Post\_{t}\times Treated\_{c}+\gamma\_{1}Post\_{t}\times Treated\_{c}\times FounderExpertise\_{i}+X\_{it}+\psi\_{c}+\phi\_{t}+\nu\_{ct} |  | (3) |

The outcome F​u​n​d​e​dFunded indicates whether the venture ii launched in category cc in year-quarter tt eventually received venture capital (VC) funding by 2025Q3, which is a measure of superior performance and hyper-scaling potential. The coefficient γ0\gamma\_{0} estimates the baseline treatment effect, and γ1\gamma\_{1} estimates the interaction effect with respect to F​o​u​n​d​e​r​E​x​p​e​r​t​i​s​eFounderExpertise, a dichotomous indicator measured based on the primary founder’s ex-ante work experience or educational training prior to launching the venture. These indicators include two types of expertise: technical expertise variables include Computer Occupation and STEM Degree; managerial expertise variables include Managerial Occupation and Advanced Business Degree. Appendix Section [C](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#A3 "Appendix C Description of Variables in Empirical Analyses ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") defines these variables and details how they are measured.

The regression model in Equation [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.E3 "In 3.4.2 Effects on Venture Performance: Venture-Level Sample ‣ Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") additionally controls for venture-level characteristics Xi​tX\_{it}, such as founding team size and the primary founder’s age group, gender, location, and educational attainment. Furthermore, the regression model also includes product category fixed effects ψc\psi\_{c} and year-quarter fixed effects ϕt\phi\_{t}. It is infeasible to control for venture fixed effects because each venture’s first public launch occurs exactly once. Instead, we account for the potentially confounding effects of venture-specific characteristics by directly including these variables in the regression (similar to \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBNasamgenerative\@BBCP). Robust standard errors are clustered at the category level, since treatment is defined at this level.

## Results

### Effects of GenAI on Number of First-Time Launches and Time to Launch

Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") shows the regression results from estimating the difference-in-differences model in Equation [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.E2 "In 3.4.1 Effects on Entrepreneurial Access: Quarterly Panel of Product Categories ‣ Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"). The coefficient estimates in columns 1 and 2 suggest that GenAI for coding significantly increased the number of first-time venture launches in treated (relative to control) categories by 42% and reduced the time between having an operational website and a first-time launch by 17%. These estimates are consistent with GenAI speeding up product development and lowering resource barriers to launching digital ventures.

In Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), estimated outcomes in each year-quarter are plotted separately for treated and control groups, based on the event study model estimates. These estimates allow for a visual examination of the parallel trends assumption and the treatment effect timing. The figure shows that both the number of first-time launches in panel (a) and the median time to launch in panel (b) followed similar trends before the treatment in 2022Q3, since the differences in estimated outcomes between the treated and control groups are close to zero and statistically insignificant in all quarters. For the timing of treatment effects, the estimated outcomes in both panel (a) and panel (b) did not significantly diverge until 2023Q1, approximately two quarters after the beginning of treatment. This is reasonable given that the median venture in the sample takes about five months to launch after website creation (see descriptive statistics in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures")). In addition, categories in the control group also experienced somewhat reduced time to launch and an increased number of launches, albeit to a smaller degree than those in the treated group. Insofar as GenAI for coding broadly affects all kinds of software tasks, our results can be interpreted as the impact of an increase in GenAI usage, rather than that of adopting GenAI (relative to not using GenAI at all).

To examine the robustness of these analyses and the validity of our data, we estimate the treatment effects separately for different types of ventures, based on demographic groups of their primary founders at the time of launch. Recent research shows that GenAI adoption has been uneven across demographic characteristics at the individual level \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(humlum2025unequal; bick2025impact; daniotti2025using)\@BBCP. It is reasonable to assume that the effects of GenAI on first-time venture launches should be larger for founder demographic groups that are shown to adopt GenAI at higher rates in the prior literature. Hence, we construct different measures of first-time launches based on subsamples of ventures in which the primary founders belong to different demographic groups (e.g., educational attainment, age group, gender, and location). Different categorical values of a demographic characteristic are associated with a separate outcome measure in the difference-in-differences regression model in Equation [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.E2 "In 3.4.1 Effects on Entrepreneurial Access: Quarterly Panel of Product Categories ‣ Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), Section [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.SS4 "Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"). We then compare coefficients across separate regressions (with correlated error terms) using each of these outcome variables corresponding to a distinct value of the demographic characteristic. We use the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model, which combines separate regressions to perform joint estimation \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(zellner1962efficient)\@BBCP, and then conduct a Wald test on the null hypothesis that the resulting coefficient estimates are equal across the two regressions. The resulting pp-value of the Wald test statistic indicates whether we can reject the null hypothesis of equality between the coefficient estimates from these separate regressions.

Appendix Table [A2](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#A1.T2 "Table A2 ‣ Appendix A Additional Tables and Figures ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") shows the coefficient estimates for outcome variables corresponding to each category of educational attainment, age group, gender, and location associated with a venture’s primary founder. The estimates in columns 1 - 2 indicate that GenAI for coding had twice as large an effect on first-time launches by founders with bachelor’s degrees as on those by founders with only high school degrees, and the difference is significant (pp=0.054) according to the SUR estimation and the Wald test. Similarly, the estimates in columns 3 - 4 indicate that the treatment effect is twice as large among young founders (age 45 or below) as among older founders (age 46+), and the difference is significant (pp=0.085) according to the SUR estimation and the Wald test. These differences across educational attainment and age groups are consistent with recent GenAI adoption statistics at the population level, showing that younger \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(humlum2025unequal)\@BBCP and college-educated \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(bick2025impact)\@BBCP adults are much more likely to use GenAI. In addition, columns 5 - 6 show an 18% lower coefficient estimate for new venture launches by female primary founders than by male primary founders, and columns 7 - 9 show a 30% lower coefficient estimate for new venture launches by founders in Asia than by founders in North America and Europe. Neither of these differences is statistically significant at or below the 10% level according to the SUR estimation and the Wald test, though they are directionally consistent with prior findings that document uneven GenAI adoption across gender \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(humlum2025unequal)\@BBCP and location \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(daniotti2025using)\@BBCP. Overall, these results largely agree with recent findings of uneven GenAI adoption across demographic groups, and provide evidence supporting the validity of our data and analyses.

### Founder Expertise and GenAI Effects on First-Time Launches

We explore the differential effects of GenAI on first-time launches across founders with different types of professional expertise - specifically, managerial and technical expertise - measured by their work experience and educational background prior to launching their ventures. We use the same method for comparing the effects across demographic groups as described in Section [4.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S4.SS1 "Effects of GenAI on Number of First-Time Launches and Time to Launch ‣ Results ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures").

Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") shows the regression results, with columns 1-4 focusing on managerial expertise and columns 5-8 focusing on technical expertise of the venture’s primary founder. In columns 1 and 2, the outcome variables are constructed based on whether the venture’s primary founder’s last job (if any) prior to launching the focal venture was in a managerial occupation, defined as having a 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code in major group 11 (i.e., Management Occupations). The coefficient estimates indicate substantially - about 90% - larger treatment effects for founders who did not transition from managerial occupations than for founders who did, and the difference is significant at the 1% level (SUR estimation and Wald test p=0.002p=0.002) for rejecting coefficient equality. In columns 3 and 4, the sample consists only of observations where the primary founder’s educational background is observed in the Revelio data, and the outcome variables are constructed based on whether they have an advanced degree (i.e., master’s level or above) in a business-related field – business, economics, marketing, finance, or accounting. The size of the coefficient estimates is twice as large for the outcome involving founders without advanced business degrees as for the outcome involving founders with advanced business degrees, and the difference is significant at the 1% level (SUR estimation and Wald test p=0.006p=0.006). Thus, GenAI led to substantially more founders without managerial experience or training launching new ventures relative to founders with a managerial background. These results imply that GenAI may especially lower the resource barriers related to performing managerial tasks, including securing financial capital and human resources for launching the venture and coordinating knowledge across different operational domains.

In columns 5 and 6 of Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T3 "Table 3 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), the outcome variables are constructed based on whether the venture’s primary founder’s last job (if any) prior to launching the focal venture was in a computer occupation, defined as having a 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code in the minor group 15-12 (i.e., Computer Occupations) or among 11-3021 (Computer and Information Systems Managers), 17-2061 (Computer Hardware Engineers), and 25-1021 (Computer Science Teachers, Postsecondary). The coefficient estimates indicate statistically similar treatment effects regardless of whether founders transitioned from a computer-related job (SUR estimation and Wald test p=0.495p=0.495). In columns 7 and 8, the sample consists only of observations where the primary founder’s educational background is observed in the Revelio data, and the outcome variables are constructed based on whether the primary founder has a degree in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field. The sizes of the coefficient estimates are almost identical regardless of whether the outcome involves ventures for which the primary founder has a STEM degree at the bachelor’s level or above (SUR estimation and Wald test p=0.965p=0.965). Thus, GenAI has a similar effect on first-time launches across founders with and without technical experience and training. This result is somewhat surprising, given that “vibe-coding” platforms often promote themselves as the “technical co-founders” that allow aspiring non-technical entrepreneurs to found software ventures without writing code themselves. Instead, our empirical results suggest that, apart from lowering entry barriers for non-technical founders, GenAI may improve the efficiency of development workflows for technical founders at the same time.

### Founder Expertise and GenAI Effects on Venture Performance

In this section, we show the regression results from estimating the effects of GenAI on sample ventures’ probability of raising venture capital (VC) funding, which is an indicator of performance beyond the initial launch. Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") shows the results from estimating the regression model in Equation [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.E3 "In 3.4.2 Effects on Venture Performance: Venture-Level Sample ‣ Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), Section [3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S3.SS4 "Research Design ‣ Empirical Framework ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") on the venture-level sample described in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), for which time to launch is non-missing. In column 1 of Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), the baseline coefficient estimates show an overall null effect of category-level GenAI usage on the probability that a venture raises VC funding. However, our analyses focus on heterogeneous effects across founders, particularly the role of managerial and technical expertise in shaping how effectively GenAI is utilized to achieve superior performance.

In Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures"), the model underlying the estimates in column 2 includes the interaction between the treatment indicator (Treated ×\times Post) and a managerial occupation indicator for the primary founder’s last job before launching the venture (L​a​s​t​J​o​b​M​a​n​a​g​e​r​i​a​lLastJobManagerial). The coefficient estimate on the interaction term suggests that managerial experience negatively influences the relationship between high GenAI usage and the probability of raising VC funding (β\beta=-0.029, p<p<0.001). Similarly, the regression model underlying the estimates in column 3 includes the interaction between the treatment indicator and a computer occupation indicator for the primary founder’s last job before launching the venture (L​a​s​t​J​o​b​C​o​m​p​u​t​e​rLastJobComputer). In contrast, the coefficient estimate on the interaction term suggests that technical experience positively influences the relationship between high GenAI usage and the probability of raising VC funding (β\beta=0.014, pp=0.031).

Columns 4 and 5 of Table [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T4 "Table 4 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") show results analogous to those in columns 2 and 3, using the founders’ educational background instead of their last occupation to measure their managerial or technical training. The model underlying column 4 includes the interaction between the treatment indicator and a binary indicator for whether the primary founder had a master’s or higher-level business-related degree (A​d​v.B​u​s​i​n​e​s​s​D​e​g​r​e​eAdv.BusinessDegree), such as an MBA. The model underlying column 5 includes the interaction between the treatment indicator and a binary indicator for whether the primary founder had a bachelor’s or higher-level degree in a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics field (H​a​s​S​T​E​M​D​e​g​r​e​eHasSTEMDegree). The estimated coefficients show no significant interaction effect for an advanced business degree (β\beta=-0.010, pp=0.129) and a positive interaction effect for a STEM degree (β\beta=0.012, pp=0.004).

These results suggest that founders with technical expertise - either through STEM higher education or working in computer professions - use GenAI more effectively, as reflected by their ventures’ ability to secure VC funding. On the other hand, managerial work experience negatively influences the relationship between GenAI coding tools and the venture’s probability of raising VC funding. Together, these findings offer evidence of how different types of professional expertise influence the effectiveness with which founders may utilize GenAI to develop their digital ventures and achieve superior performance beyond the initial launch.

To interpret these results, we draw on the knowledge perspective of GenAI’s capabilities and its implications for venture development. Previous research on data analytics shows that it facilitates knowledge recombination across domains \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(wu2020data)\@BBCP, and recent research also shows that GenAI may expand the search space for knowledge and lower the costs of combining information across distant domains \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(dell2025cybernetic)\@BBCP. However, GenAI produces outputs by retrieving and recombining shallow knowledge, because the software code used to train large language models (LLMs) underrepresents highly complex or frontier technical knowledge, which is less likely to be publicly available for training. Thus, GenAI is more capable of generalist tasks than of specialist tasks, and therefore the former are more prone to replacement by GenAI than the latter. Managerial roles are often generalist, responsible for synthesizing relatively shallow expertise across a larger number of domains to inform decision-making \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(grant1996toward; autor2003skill)\@BBCP, whereas technical roles are often specialist, involving new knowledge creation enabled by deep expertise in a narrower set of domains without spanning boundaries \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(ferreira2012gets)\@BBCP. GenAI makes the recombination of shallow knowledge less costly, thus substituting managerial expertise that involves coordination across domains, while complementing technical expertise that involves reasoning with deeper knowledge within a domain.

## Discussion and Conclusion

This study explores how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) affects potential digital ventures’ first-time launches and longer-run performance. We use the exogenous variation in GenAI usage at the venture category level and the timing of the first cohort of GenAI for coding to identify causal effects in a difference-in-differences regression framework. Combining Product Hunt data with several proprietary databases on ventures and founders, our empirical analyses show that venture categories with high GenAI usage experienced significantly more first-time launches and shorter time to launch relative to venture categories with low GenAI usage after GenAI coding became widely available. We also find that treatment effects are larger among ventures with college-educated and young founders (and to a smaller extent, male and US/Europe-based founders), consistent with recent research (e.g., \@BBOPcitet\@BAP\@BBNhumlum2025unequal; daniotti2025using; bick2025impact\@BBCP) showing that these demographic groups have higher population-level GenAI adoption rates.

GenAI may affect digital ventures through two channels: (1) It may increase access to entrepreneurship by lowering resource needs and thus increasing the economic feasibility of certain business ideas; (2) It may enhance the productivity of the founding team in performing venture development tasks and implementing their ideas. However, the extent to which GenAI can be effectively leveraged through both channels varies across ventures. In our analyses, we focus on the role of founders’ expertise in contributing to such heterogeneity, and our empirical results provide evidence that GenAI may complement technical expertise and substitute managerial expertise, since ventures where the primary founder has a technical background or lacks a managerial background seem to benefit more from GenAI through both access and productivity channels.

We interpret the results in light of GenAI’s relationship with humans performing generalist versus specialist tasks. Since GenAI coding tools are trained on publicly available software code and related information, they are more likely to capture shallow knowledge and automate the lower-level expertise that is more easily understood by non-technical founders, and less likely to replicate the deep domain expertise of technical founders. Echoing the findings from prior research that data analytics supports innovation based on knowledge recombination \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(wu2020data)\@BBCP, GenAI can also broaden the information search space across existing knowledge, and allow individuals to more effectively retrieve and combine diverse knowledge across distant domains. To the extent that managerial professions often require a relatively shallow generalist understanding of diverse domains, in order to gather information across these domains and combine them to make strategic decisions, GenAI can perform managerial tasks that involve coordinating across different knowledge domains with a relatively shallow understanding of each. Our results are consistent with specialists being positioned to benefit more from GenAI coding tools relative to generalists, due to their deeper understanding of a fast-moving domain that enables more effective local search \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(kaplan2015double; teodoridis2019creativity)\@BBCP, which cannot be replaced by current GenAI capabilities. We find that GenAI adoption and gains are higher in ventures where founders have complementary expertise, consistent with predictions from the theory of human capital complementarity in explaining the diffusion of new information technologies \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(aral2012three; wu2020data)\@BBCP.

### Contribution to the literature

This study adds to several bodies of literature. First, we contribute to the increasing volume of work on generative AI’s impact on entrepreneurship \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(asamgenerative; bao2025generative; otis2024uneven)\@BBCP. Our focus is on digital ventures, where software tasks are essential for venture development activities. On the one hand, our work is related to the literature on how information technologies lower resource barriers and increase entrepreneurial entry \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(ewens2018cost; dushnitsky2021low)\@BBCP. On the other hand, this paper also relates to the literature that examines how information technologies improve organizational performance when complementary human capital is present \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(bresnahan2002information; aral2012three; tambe2014big)\@BBCP. Relative to prior work, our theoretical framework combines both channels, and our empirical results show that GenAI usage can both enhance access to entrepreneurship by reducing resource needs for launching digital ventures and improve venture performance at the same time, particularly when the founders have complementary expertise.

Second, our study is relevant to research on founder expertise as a source of differentiation among firms seeking to benefit from GenAI usage \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(barney2001resource; csaszar2025unbounding)\@BBCP. Specifically, such differentiation depends on the capabilities of GenAI itself. Frontier LLMs are strong in retrieving and recombining knowledge from across a large number of domains, but are weak at attaining or deriving deep domain knowledge required for technically complex problems that often arise when operating digital ventures. Hence, GenAI may exhibit characteristics more of a generalist than of a specialist, and thus automate managerial expertise that involves combining shallow knowledge from across diverse domains \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(ferreira2012gets)\@BBCP, while complementing technical expertise that embodies deep or frontier knowledge within a narrow domain \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(teodoridis2019creativity; kaplan2015double)\@BBCP. While GenAI may be widely available to potential entrepreneurs at a relatively low cost, firms’ internal capabilities may determine whether they can effectively exploit opportunities and derive a competitive advantage from using the technology \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(csaszar2025unbounding; krakowski2023artificial; giustiziero2023hyperspecialization)\@BBCP, with human capital playing an important role in shaping firms’ value creation from information technologies \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(bresnahan2002information; aral2012three; tambe2014big; wu2020data)\@BBCP.

Third, our study speaks to how generative AI affects the way knowledge work is conducted within organizations and in professions such as software development \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(peng2023impact; cui2025effects)\@BBCP, management consulting \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(dell2023navigating)\@BBCP, customer service \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(brynjolfsson2025generative)\@BBCP, and writing \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(noy2023experimental; doshi2025generative)\@BBCP. Recent empirical studies have largely focused on the productivity effects of GenAI in performing a single well-defined task in a controlled experimental setting. This study complements these prior works by exploring the aggregate impact of GenAI on real-world digital ventures, where software tasks are essential for product development and operational activities. Our empirical findings suggest that GenAI may not only improve efficiency in performing standalone tasks but also change the role of expertise and the configuration of activities performed by humans who use GenAI, thereby shaping the overall effects of GenAI at the organizational level.

### Managerial implications

Our study offers several insights for potential founders and joiners of digital ventures on how to adapt to rapid changes in technology affordances due to the rise of generative AI. We find that founders with technical expertise and without managerial expertise derive greater benefits from GenAI coding tools, at least within the first few years since Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPTs) became widely accessible. While GenAI adoption for software-related tasks may not necessarily lead to superior performance or competitive advantage at the organizational level, our findings reveal substantial patterns of complementarity between the existing expertise of founders and GenAI coding tools for digital entrepreneurship. To more effectively use GenAI, entrepreneurs should consider the technology’s uneven capabilities across both the breadth and depth of different knowledge domains, and navigate complex relationships between GenAI and different types of expertise to co-create solutions. Potential founders should consider not only how GenAI fills skill gaps in prototyping a working website but also evaluate the prospects of incorporating GenAI more effectively into their workflows at different stages of venture development. Hence, they should pay attention not only to how GenAI relieves resource constraints but also recognize the need to develop complementary capabilities to derive larger gains from GenAI usage.

In addition, technology diffusion can substantially reshape the direction of innovation. Our findings imply that the widespread adoption of GenAI can sharply increase the entry of new firms into market areas more exposed to the technology compared to other areas. Despite benefiting from accelerated product development and efficiency gains, digital ventures may also experience fiercer competition for market share due to industry-wide GenAI adoption. Widespread GenAI usage may not only result in disproportionate entry of new products and services in some market areas but also lead to stronger competition for incumbents in these areas due to lower entry barriers. Hence, both entrepreneurs and incumbent firms in these market areas should be aware of the changing competitive landscape and the demand-side implications of GenAI, and make informed decisions that take into account these market-level changes resulting from the widespread adoption of the technology by competing firms. In response, they should foster a deeper understanding of the technology’s evolving capabilities and develop complementary capabilities that allow them to co-create solutions with the technology more effectively than their competitors.

### Limitations and future research

This study has several limitations that open up avenues for future research. One limitation is that state-of-the-art GenAI capabilities advance rapidly. While GenAI in its early days may lack the ability to retrieve deeper domain knowledge or perform more complex technical tasks, these caveats are also opportunities for AI startups to exploit and address unmet needs across different customer niches, introducing new products and services that fill market gaps \@BBOPcitep\@BAP\@BBN(shane2000promise)\@BBCP. For example, while there were no GenAI-powered mobile app builders in 2023, Vibecode and Rork launched in late 2025, both enabling the creation of fully deployable mobile apps through GenAI prompting. Moreover, future GenAI systems for knowledge work may involve a large number of specialized LLMs trained on domain-specific data to tackle more complex tasks, instead of a general-purpose LLM with continuously improving capabilities. These specialized LLMs may be able to access not only publicly available knowledge but also proprietary data that incorporate deep domain-specific knowledge, and thus embody increasingly advanced expertise. Thus, future research should address the dynamic nature of GenAI capabilities and study how organizations position themselves to proactively manage or reactively adapt to GenAI as an evolving technology over time.

Another limitation of this study is that we did not separately measure the impact of GenAI on different stages of venture development, such as idea generation, prototyping and testing, marketing and customer acquisition, after-sales services, and internal operations. In addition, our results focus on founders as individuals to analyze the role of distinct types of expertise, and do not account for interactions between team members who may use GenAI individually or jointly. Therefore, future research can explore dynamic interpersonal and intertemporal dependencies in shaping how GenAI capabilities are incorporated into venture development. More work remains to be done to understand how teams coordinate across different GenAI systems and address limitations of these systems, how GenAI affects entrepreneurial decisions in different operational areas at different stages, and how path dependency in these decisions shapes GenAI usage in downstream tasks.

In particular, we clarify how our data construction recovers the information hierarchy of the Product Hunt structure by tracing launch posts (PostId) to products (ProductId) and then to the parent organization (websiteDomain666The only exceptions are platform complementors, in particular, mobile apps, Chrome extensions, and Google Workspace software.). This process leaves about 106,757 firms in the sample period (January 2021 to mid-2025) in the final dataset.

1. 1.

   Fixing the unit of analysis at the venture level. Our primary unit of analysis is a venture rather than a product or launch post, as our analyses focus on entrepreneurial firms and their founders rather than product lines within established companies. We to focus on ventures also because more information is available at the organizational level by matching each venture’s website domain to external databases containing outcomes such as funding (e.g., PitchBook).
2. 2.

   Removing non-launch posts (with no makers tagged). To focus on firms’ intended public launches rather than hunter-initiated product discoveries, we keep only launch posts that tag at least one maker. Posts without tagged makers are not firm-initiated but externally hunted, typically by unaffiliated users discovering and posting a product after it has already been widely adopted.
3. 3.

   Pruning the data to focus on entrepreneurial firms. Because the raw data come from an open platform that accepts a wide range of posts with few restrictions, we prune the dataset to include only entrepreneurial firms in our empirical sample. Starting from all Product Hunt launch posts linked to their associated products and parent organizations, we filter the data to retain only launches that meet the criteria for entrepreneurial ventures. The process for constructing the final sample is outlined as follows:

   * •

     Remove podcast episodes, games, and books. This step removes all launch posts categorized as podcast episodes, games, or books.
   * •

     Remove content hosted on platforms without standalone domains.777An exception is made for mobile apps, browser extensions, and Google Workspace offerings because they are major software products. Specifically, these launches share URLs beginning with <itunes.apple.com>, <play.google.com>, <apps.apple.com>, <chrome.google.com>, <chromewebstore.google.com>, <apple.co>, <workspace.google.com>, <gsuite.google.com>, or <onelink.me>. This step removes launch posts by platform complementors, including but not limited to design templates, OpenAI marketplace chatbots, Amazon or Etsy shops, and low-code apps using an AI coding platform’s domain.
   * •

     Remove parent organizations with too many launch posts. If a remaining parent organization is associated with more than 30 launch posts, it is likely an established company releasing multiple software tools rather than an entrepreneurial firm using the platform for marketing and early customer acquisition, and is therefore removed. Fewer than 50 such organizations remain in the data at this stage before removal.
   * •

     Remove organizations too old to be launching for the first time. Using the website domain creation date (i.e., the first detection of a domain’s existence across multiple sources – see the Data Appendix888Available upon request or for peer-review purposes. for replication details), we trim the data by removing organizations whose standalone domains were created more than six years before their first public launch on Product Hunt. Such organizations are unlikely to be new entrepreneurial firms but rather established software companies resurfacing with a new feature launch.
4. 4.

   Consolidate information on the first launch and overall firm. We combine data from launch posts, products, and external databases linked to each parent organization to construct two types of variables for each organization:

   * •

     Time of the organization’s first launch: We identify the earliest timestamped launch post across all products sharing the same organization identifier (primarily the domain name) and treat it as the startup’s launch date. Although a firm may launch multiple times under the same product (e.g., feature updates or new versions) or across distinct product lines, we use the first post on Product Hunt to mark when the firm conducted its initial public launch to acquire early users. This approach captures both the initial public launch and the time-to-launch measure (based on the website creation date, typically months or years before the initial public launch).
   * •

     Organizational and founder descriptive variables: We combine data from all products and launch posts linked to the same parent organization to construct organization-level variables. These include the venture category (indicated in the first launch post)999Because ventures may pivot later, we define their initial category using information from the first launch. In most cases, a venture has a single product and a single launch, though less frequently it may have multiple products and additional launches, such as updates or new feature releases., founding team size (the number of makers tagged in the first launch), founder clout (the primary founder’s number of followers), and other organizational measures matched to external databases such as PitchBook.
5. 5.

   Match founders from Product Hunt makers to LinkedIn profiles. We obtain additional founder information by matching makers’ Product Hunt accounts to their LinkedIn profiles (see the Data Appendix101010Available upon request or for peer-review purposes. for matching details). Founders are identified from the makers tagged in each organization’s first launch post. We then construct a founder–firm–level dataset and aggregate it to the firm level to create founding team measures, including the primary founder’s demographics (location, age, and gender), work experience, and education history.

## Appendix C Description of Variables in Empirical Analyses

We describe the key variables summarized in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.06545v1#S5.T1 "Table 1 ‣ Limitations and future research ‣ Discussion and Conclusion ‣ How Founder Expertise Shapes the Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Digital Ventures") and define them as follows. Some variables are based on the primary founder, identified as the lead maker tagged in the venture’s first public launch post on Product Hunt.

Venture Category. Product Hunt assigns each product launch to the category that best matches its type. The venture category variable reflects the category assigned to the venture’s first launch on Product Hunt. As described in the main paper, we restrict the sample to large categories with at least 100 launches between January 2021 and June 2025. Each venture in the final sample belongs to one of 85 distinct categories.

Time to Launch (Months). This variable measures the number of months between the website’s creation (see the Data Appendix111111Available upon request or for peer-review purposes. for measurement details) and the venture’s first public launch on Product Hunt. It serves as a proxy for the time required to develop the initial product from the start of business idea implementation.

Raised VC Funding. This binary variable indicates whether a venture raised venture capital (VC) funding – including seed, early-stage, and late-stage rounds, but excluding accelerator participation, loans, crowdfunding, and grants – by the end of the sample period (2025Q3). It is constructed by merging Product Hunt and PitchBook data using the venture’s website domain.

Founding Team Size. This variable counts the number of “makers” listed in the Product Hunt post for a venture’s first public launch. It captures the founding team size, as the “makers” represent the core members behind the venture’s initial public product launch.

Primary Founder Number of Followers on Product Hunt. This variable records the number of users following the primary founder’s Product Hunt account as of mid-2025. It serves as a proxy for the founder’s clout or influence in attracting customers to the venture.

Primary Founder Educational Attainment. Three educational attainment indicators – High School, Bachelor’s, and Master’s or Above – are constructed based on the highest degree earned by the lead “maker” in the venture’s first Product Hunt launch. Education data come from Revelio: High School includes individuals whose highest degree is “Associate” or “High School”; Bachelor’s includes those with a “Bachelor” degree; and Master’s or Above includes those with “Master,” “MBA,” or “Doctor” degrees.

Primary Founder Age Group. Three age-group indicators – Age 16–25, Age 26–45, and Age 46+ – are based on the inferred age of the lead “maker” in the venture’s first Product Hunt launch. Using Revelio data, we estimate birth year as (1) college start year minus 18; (2) high school start year minus 15 if (1) is unavailable; or (3) first job start year minus 18 if both (1) and (2) are unavailable.

Primary Founder Gender. Two gender indicators – Female and Male – are based on Revelio’s gender variable for the lead “maker” in the venture’s first Product Hunt launch.

Primary Founder Location. Three location indicators – North America, Europe, and Asia – are based on Revelio’s country variable for the lead “maker” in the venture’s first Product Hunt launch. Locations are aggregated from country to continent level, and the sample includes only ventures whose primary founder is in North America, Europe, or Asia.

Primary Founder Last Job Occupation. Several indicators are based on the lead “maker”’s most recent job before the venture’s first public Product Hunt launch. A founder’s last job is defined in Revelio as the position with the highest rank in lexicographic order of start–end date pairs among jobs that (1) lasted more than six months (indicating a formal role rather than an internship or short-term contract), (2) began no later than one year prior, and (3) either remained active or ended within two years prior. Definitions of occupation indicators follow the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system. The Last Job Computer indicator corresponds to SOC codes 15-12XX (Computer Occupations), 11-3021 (Computer and Information Systems Managers), 17-2061 (Computer Hardware Engineers), and 25-1021 (Computer Science Teachers, Postsecondary), while the Las Job Managerial indicator corresponds to SOC codes 11-XXXX (Managerial Occupations).

Primary Founder Education Degree Field. Several indicators are based on the lead “maker”’s degree fields. The Has Adv. Business Degree indicator denotes completion of a master’s or higher degree (i.e., Master, MBA, or Doctor) in a business-related field such as business, economics, marketing, finance, or accounting. The Has STEM Degree indicator denotes completion of a bachelor’s or higher degree (i.e., Bachelor, Master, MBA, or Doctor) in engineering, information technology, mathematics, or physics.
