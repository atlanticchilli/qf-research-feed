Table B.1: Search effort by elapsed duration

* •

  Notes: The table shows the average per month within-spell change in the probability of reporting other job search activities aside from applying for jobs (columns 1–4) and the number of applied-for jobs conditional on having submitted an activity report, by different segments of elapsed duration. The estimates come from the regression: yi​t=αi+∑k[γk​(Dk×t)+δk​Dk]+εi​ty\_{it}=\alpha\_{i}+\sum\_{k}\left[\gamma\_{k}(D\_{k}\times t)+\delta\_{k}D\_{k}\right]+\varepsilon\_{it} where tt denotes months in unemployment, and DkD\_{k} is an indicator equal to one if tt falls within interval k∈{[2,11],[12,14],[15,18],[19,21],[22,28]}k\in\{[2,11],[12,14],[15,18],[19,21],[22,28]\} and 0 otherwise. Columns (2), (4), (6) and (8) show the implied average percentage change per month calculated by plugging in the predictions from the ends of each interval k∈[k¯,k¯]k\in[\underline{k},\overline{k}] into the compound decay formula: Δk%=1−(y^k¯/y^k¯)1k¯−k¯\Delta\_{k}\%=1-\left(\hat{y}\_{\overline{k}}/\hat{y}\_{\underline{k}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\overline{k}-\underline{k}}}. All spells are right-censored at the last two calendar months of each unemployment spell. Standard errors are in parenthesis and clustered at the spell level. Asterisks indicate that the estimates are significantly different from zero at the ∗ p<0.1p<0.1, ∗∗ p<0.05p<0.05, ∗∗∗ p<0.01p<0.01 level.

Notes: The Figure shows the evolution of within-spell search intensity relative to unemployment onset for job seekers entitled to 14 months of UI. Estimates come from estimating equation ([2](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.03377v1#S2.E2 "In 2.4 Empirical strategy ‣ 2 Institutional setting, data & empirical strategy ‣ Duration Dependence and Job Search over the Spell: Evidence from Job Seeker Activity ReportsWe would like to thank Per-Anders Edin, Simon Ek, Peter Fredriksson, Axel Gottfries, Nikolaj Harmon, Jonas Maibom, Roland Rathelot and seminar participants at UCLS Annual Conference, IFAU, University of Edinburgh.

The circles represent average within-spell search effort in each month whereas the dashed colored lines show linear predictions in different segments of elapsed duration. Surrounding the linear predictions are 95% confidence bands with standard errors are clustered at the spell level. Panel a) show search intensity for native (blue) and non-native (red) job seekers whereas panel b) show male (blue) and female (red) job seekers. Panel c) show estimates for job seeker targeting high (blue) and low-skilled (red) occupations as defined by their stated occupational preferences at the beginning of the unemployment spell. Panel d) displays estimates for spell ongoing in tight (blue) and slack (red) local labor markets, defined by the average regional×\timesquarterly vacancy rate being above and below the median in the distribution, respectively. In all regressions we right-censor the last two calendar months of each unemployment spell, considering duration dependence until finding a new job.

Notes: Notes: The figure shows the evolution of the probability of attending an interview relative to unemployment onset. The circles connected by dashed lines show estimates from equation ([1](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.03377v1#S2.E1 "In 2.4 Empirical strategy ‣ 2 Institutional setting, data & empirical strategy ‣ Duration Dependence and Job Search over the Spell: Evidence from Job Seeker Activity ReportsWe would like to thank Per-Anders Edin, Simon Ek, Peter Fredriksson, Axel Gottfries, Nikolaj Harmon, Jonas Maibom, Roland Rathelot and seminar participants at UCLS Annual Conference, IFAU, University of Edinburgh.

Figure C.6: Duration dependence by age with and w/o controlling for search effort

![Refer to caption](x41.png)
  

Notes: The figure shows the within-spell average month-to-month percent change, in the probability of attending an interview during the first year of unemployment separately estimated for each age cohort. The red triangles controls for an age-specific linear trend and levels of search effort whereas the blue dots do not. Estimates come from regressing a dummy of having a attended an interview on a continuous variable of elapsed unemployment duration, including time and spell fixed effects. We then take the linear predictions of this model and calculate the implied average percentage change per month using the compound decay formula: Δk%=1−(y^k¯/y^k¯)1k¯−k¯\Delta\_{k}\%=1-\left(\hat{y}\_{\overline{k}}/\hat{y}\_{\underline{k}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\overline{k}-\underline{k}}} where k∈{2,12}k\in\{2,12\}. The dashed lines show a uniformly weighted quadratic fit over the estimates along with a 95% prediction interval. All spells are right-censored at the last two calendar months of each unemployment spell.

## Appendix D Derivation of the mapping between the share of duration dependence in callbacks and job-finding

We start by defining the job-finding rate (hh) for a job seeker as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | h​(x,t)=λo​(x,t)​λi​(x,t)h(x,t)=\lambda\_{o}(x,t)\lambda\_{i}(x,t) |  | (D.1) |

where λo\lambda\_{o} the job-offer arrival rate conditional on getting an interview and λi​(x,t)\lambda\_{i}(x,t) is the probability of being called to an interview. These are both a functions of elapsed time in unemployment tt and job seeker characteristics x∈𝒳x\in\mathcal{X} at time tt with a cross-sectional density function f​(x;t)f(x;t) normalized such that ∫𝒳f​(x;t)​𝑑x=1\int\_{\mathcal{X}}f(x;t)\,dx=1.

We define the cross-sectional averages in the hazard rate, job offer arrival rate and callback probability, respectively, as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | h¯​(t)=∫𝒳h​(x,t)​f​(x;t)​𝑑x,λ¯o​(t)=∫𝒳λo​(x,t)​f​(x;t)​𝑑xλ¯i​(t)=∫𝒳λi​(x,t)​f​(x;t)​𝑑x.\bar{h}(t)=\int\_{\mathcal{X}}h(x,t)\,f(x;t)\,dx,\qquad\bar{\lambda}\_{o}(t)=\int\_{\mathcal{X}}\lambda\_{o}(x,t)\,f(x;t)\,dx\qquad\bar{\lambda}\_{i}(t)=\int\_{\mathcal{X}}\lambda\_{i}(x,t)\,f(x;t)\,dx. |  |

Let ∂t\partial\_{t} denote the derivative with respect to tt. Differentiating the above equations we get:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ∂h​(x,t)∂t\displaystyle\frac{\partial h(x,t)}{\partial t} | =(∂tλo​(x,t))​λi​(x,t)+λo​(x,t)​(∂tλi​(x,t)),\displaystyle=(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{o}(x,t))\,\lambda\_{i}(x,t)+\lambda\_{o}(x,t)\,(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i}(x,t)), |  | (D.2) |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​h¯​(t)d​t\displaystyle\frac{d\bar{h}(t)}{dt} | =∫𝒳[(∂tλo)​λi​f+λo​(∂tλi)​f+λo​λi​(∂tf)]​𝑑x,\displaystyle=\int\_{\mathcal{X}}\Big[(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{o})\lambda\_{i}f+\lambda\_{o}(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i})f+\lambda\_{o}\lambda\_{i}(\partial\_{t}f)\Big]\,dx, |  | (D.3) |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | d​λ¯i​(t)d​t\displaystyle\frac{d\bar{\lambda}\_{i}(t)}{dt} | =∫𝒳[(∂tλi)​f+λi​(∂tf)]​𝑑x.\displaystyle=\int\_{\mathcal{X}}\Big[(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i})f+\lambda\_{i}(\partial\_{t}f)\Big]\,dx. |  | (D.4) |

which are true duration dependence in the hazard rate, observed duration dependence in the hazard rate and the observed duration dependence in the interview probability, respectively. Dividing equation D.2 by D.3, we get the share of true duration dependence in in the job-finding rate:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℛh​(x,t)≡∂h​(x,t)/∂td​h¯​(t)/d​t=(∂tλo)​λi+λo​(∂tλi)∫𝒳[(∂tλo)​λi​f+λo​(∂tλi)​f+λo​λi​(∂tf)]​𝑑x\mathcal{R}\_{h}(x,t)\equiv\frac{\partial h(x,t)/\partial t}{\,d\bar{h}(t)/dt\,}=\frac{(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{o})\lambda\_{i}+\lambda\_{o}(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i})}{\displaystyle\int\_{\mathcal{X}}\!\Big[(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{o})\lambda\_{i}f+\lambda\_{o}(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i})f+\lambda\_{o}\lambda\_{i}(\partial\_{t}f)\Big]\,dx} |  | (D.5) |

The share of true duration dependence in callback rates is similarly defined by the ratio:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ℛi​(x,t)≡∂λi​(x,t)/∂td​λ¯i​(t)/d​t=∂tλi​(x,t)∫𝒳[(∂tλi)​f+λi​(∂tf)]​𝑑x\mathcal{R}\_{i}(x,t)\equiv\frac{\partial\lambda\_{i}(x,t)/\partial t}{\,d\bar{\lambda}\_{i}(t)/dt\,}=\frac{\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i}(x,t)}{\displaystyle\int\_{\mathcal{X}}\!\Big[(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i})f+\lambda\_{i}(\partial\_{t}f)\Big]\,dx} |  | (D.6) |

There are two conditions equation ([D.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.03377v1#A4.E5 "In Appendix D Derivation of the mapping between the share of duration dependence in callbacks and job-finding ‣ Duration Dependence and Job Search over the Spell: Evidence from Job Seeker Activity ReportsWe would like to thank Per-Anders Edin, Simon Ek, Peter Fredriksson, Axel Gottfries, Nikolaj Harmon, Jonas Maibom, Roland Rathelot and seminar participants at UCLS Annual Conference, IFAU, University of Edinburgh. Cederlöf gratefully acknowledges funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) Grant No. 2024-00417.")) to be approximately equal to equation ([D.6](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.03377v1#A4.E6 "In Appendix D Derivation of the mapping between the share of duration dependence in callbacks and job-finding ‣ Duration Dependence and Job Search over the Spell: Evidence from Job Seeker Activity ReportsWe would like to thank Per-Anders Edin, Simon Ek, Peter Fredriksson, Axel Gottfries, Nikolaj Harmon, Jonas Maibom, Roland Rathelot and seminar participants at UCLS Annual Conference, IFAU, University of Edinburgh. Cederlöf gratefully acknowledges funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) Grant No. 2024-00417.")) (i.e ℛh​(x,t)=ℛi​(x,t)\mathcal{R}\_{h}(x,t)=\mathcal{R}\_{i}(x,t)).

Suppose the following conditions are met:

* (A1)

  There is weak heterogeneity in job-offer arrival rates such that λo​(x,t)≈λ¯o​(t)\lambda\_{o}(x,t)\approx\bar{\lambda}\_{o}(t) at any given duration tt.
* (A2)

  There is limited duration dependence in job-offer arrival rates such that ∂tλo≈0\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{o}\approx 0

Alternatively, one could replace condition (A2) with the somewhat less strict condition:

* (A2 alt.)

  There is limited duration dependence job-offer arrival rates relative that of callbacks both

  + (A2a)

    at the individual level such that (∂tλo)​λi≪λo​(∂tλi)(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{o})\lambda\_{i}\ll\lambda\_{o}(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i}), and
  + (A2b)

    in the aggregate such that
      
    ∫𝒳(∂tλo​(x,t))​λi​(x,t)​f​(x;t)​𝑑x≪∫𝒳λo​(x,t)​(∂tλi​(x,t))​f​(x;t)​𝑑x\int\_{\mathcal{X}}(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{o}(x,t))\,\lambda\_{i}(x,t)\,f(x;t)\,dx\;\ll\;\int\_{\mathcal{X}}\lambda\_{o}(x,t)\,(\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{i}(x,t))\,f(x;t)\,dx.

Focusing on the denominator of ([D.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.03377v1#A4.E5 "In Appendix D Derivation of the mapping between the share of duration dependence in callbacks and job-finding ‣ Duration Dependence and Job Search over the Spell: Evidence from Job Seeker Activity ReportsWe would like to thank Per-Anders Edin, Simon Ek, Peter Fredriksson, Axel Gottfries, Nikolaj Harmon, Jonas Maibom, Roland Rathelot and seminar participants at UCLS Annual Conference, IFAU, University of Edinburgh. Cederlöf gratefully acknowledges funding from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) Grant No. 2024-00417.")) we add and subtract λ¯o​(t)\bar{\lambda}\_{o}(t) and note that it does not depend on xx. The denominator can then be rewritten it as:

Under assumption A1 the last term in is negligible and can be approximated as zero thus allowing the hazard ratio in equation ([D.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.03377v1#A4.E5 "In Appendix D Derivation of the mapping between the share of duration dependence in callbacks and job-finding ‣ Duration Dependence and Job Search over the Spell: Evidence from Job Seeker Activity ReportsWe would like to thank Per-Anders Edin, Simon Ek, Peter Fredriksson, Axel Gottfries, Nikolaj Harmon, Jonas Maibom, Roland Rathelot and seminar participants at UCLS Annual Conference, IFAU, University of Edinburgh.

Using assumption A2 that the job-offer arrival rate is either constant ∂tλo≈0\partial\_{t}\lambda\_{o}\approx 0, or under A2 alt. that it is small relative to the change in callbacks, the first terms in both the numerator and denominator can be ignored and the hazard ratio becomes:

where we in the last step used the the condition λo≈λ¯o​(t)⇒λo/λ¯o​(t)≈1\lambda\_{o}\approx\bar{\lambda}\_{o}(t)\Rightarrow\lambda\_{o}/\bar{\lambda}\_{o}(t)\approx 1.
