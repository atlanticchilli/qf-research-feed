###### Abstract

In the modern U.S. labor market, digital infrastructures strongly influence how individuals locate opportunities, build skills, and advance wages. Regional differences in computing access, broadband coverage, and digital literacy have significant labor implications for equity and sustainability. Drawing on longitudinal data from the NLSY97 (National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth) cohort, this study examines how place-based technological factors, personal demographics, household characteristics, and education shape income levels and decisions to seek new employment. The regression analyses reveal that educational attainment, marital status, and frequency of Internet usage strongly predict both wages and individuals’ job-seeking intensity. Regional disparities in income underscore the need for more localized interventions to ensure equitable access to technology. This study raises key questions about how digital infrastructures can reinforce or challenge systemic inequalities in underserved communities.

Key Takeaways:

1. 1.

   Demographic and Personal Factors: Personal demographics, living habits, and family backgrounds play a crucial role in shaping wages and income for individuals born in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly as technological advancements redefine income dynamics.
2. 2.

   Job-Seeking Determinants: The study identifies key demographic and personal factors that determine the likelihood of seeking full-time employment in the United States since 2010.
3. 3.

   Policy and Sustainability Implications: Addressing digital inequities through targeted interventions can promote greater equity and sustainability in regional labor markets.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background Literature Review

This paper contributes to both the literature on the factors affecting labor income and the literature on job search. From the 1980s to the 2000s, the workforce has become more gender-balanced, with higher wages and participation rates for women [blau\_changes\_2007]. Wage rates, household income, and job-seeking behaviors are critical aspects that characterize American workers’ income dynamics. What demographic, personal behavioral, and situational variables determine labor income and job-seeking behaviors?

Many factors influencing labor income have been examined. Previous research finds a positive impact of parents’ education and the child’s schooling conditions on future income [betts\_does\_1995], studies the impact of having a first child on female labor participation [cristia\_effect\_2008], the influence of no-fault divorce laws on women’s labor [genadek\_no-fault\_2007], the labor market outcomes of having a GED [song\_labor\_2011], and has used probit and OLS regression to study the impact of age, marital status, education, and health conditions on women’s labor supply [bradley\_breast\_2002].

The evolution of technology and artificial intelligence has introduced new dimensions to labor income studies. Advancements in technology have fundamentally altered the skill content of jobs, creating new opportunities while rendering certain skills obsolete [autor\_skill\_2003]. Recent studies on generative AI explore its transformative impact on workplace productivity and labor dynamics. Generative AI tools can significantly enhance productivity and quality in knowledge-intensive roles, suggesting a potential reshaping of workforce hierarchies and skill prioritization [brynjolfsson\_generative\_2023]. The uneven effects of generative AI on entrepreneurial performance reveal disparities in outcomes based on users’ ability to effectively leverage AI tools [otis\_uneven\_2024]. Experimental evidence on how AI adoption influences productivity and decision-making processes among knowledge workers underscores the complexities of navigating technological frontiers [dellacqua\_navigating\_2023]. These changes in skill demands and productivity impacts highlight the importance of understanding how workers adapt to rapidly changing environments, particularly in the context of uneven access to digital infrastructure and AI-driven tools.

In terms of job-seeking behaviors, researchers have established various predictors of these actions. A longitudinal model of demographic, personal, and situational variables predictive of job-seeking behavior has been developed [wanberg\_individuals\_1996]. The two prominent motivators of job-search intensity are identified as commitment to work and financial needs [wanberg\_unemployed\_1999]. Self-regulation and the need for reemployment also play a critical role in driving job-seeking behaviors [creed\_goal\_2009]. Identity has been shown to significantly influence economic decision-making, including labor market participation and job-seeking intensity [akerlof\_economics\_2000]. Understanding these interactions requires a nuanced approach that accounts for both individual motivations and structural factors.

The household and social implications of labor decisions and outcomes are substantial. Households adjust their spending in response to unemployment, shedding light on the financial needs that drive job-seeking intensity [ganong\_consumer\_2019]. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor market outcomes have been comprehensively analyzed, highlighting the effects on different sectors and demographic groups [chetty\_economic\_2024]. The rise of alternative work arrangements, such as gig and contract work, and their implications for labor income and job stability have also been explored, providing insights into changes in job-seeking behavior and income patterns in the contemporary labor market [katz\_understanding\_2019].

By building more holistic models to predict labor income and job-seeking willingness and intensity, our study extends these conversations to the more digitalized modern setting since 2010, where digital infrastructure and local contexts, such as regional differences in broadband access and online job-seeking tools, play a central role. Despite rapid technological progress, a ”modern productivity paradox” persists, where the economic benefits of these advancements are not evenly distributed [brynjolfsson\_artificial\_2017]. Attention frictions in the external public perceptions of corporations, which reinforce geographical disparities, have also been captured in recent research [wu\_are\_2024].

The rise of remote work platforms has fundamentally changed the landscape of job-seeking and labor markets [horton\_effects\_2017]. Digital job boards, algorithmic hiring systems, and the interplay of formal and informal strategies in navigating infrastructural and economic challenges in emerging markets have further emphasized the centrality of digitalization to questions of equity and sustainability in contemporary labor markets [eaglin\_exploring\_2021]. Our study situates itself within this evolving landscape, addressing how access to and usage of digital infrastructure mediate labor market outcomes.

### 1.2 Motivations

Pioneers in labor income and supply studies focused on married women in heterosexual binary families, laying foundational insights into these dynamics [mincer\_economic\_1996], [heckman\_life\_1980], [mroz\_sensitivity\_1987]. However, changes in social values, family structures, and labor market conditions have vastly altered these considerations. The rise of same-sex marriages, single-parent families, improved women’s status, and higher educational attainment have significantly shifted the landscape.

Previous research that examines one unique aspect of labor income factors often has its limitations. The effect of education, for instance, should be studied with more categories rather than a binary measure of whether one completed a GED [song\_labor\_2011]. This is particularly important given the increasing percentage of people achieving high school education and beyond—77.2

### 1.3 Research Questions

I address three key research questions: First, How do local computing contexts (e.g., frequency of Internet usage) and regional economic conditions jointly influence wage progression among U.S. workers born in the 1980s and 1990s? Second, To what extent do differences in digital access and usage intensify or mitigate income disparities and job-seeking behaviors across diverse regions of the U.S.? Third, Can I observe place-based patterns that suggest certain communities or demographics face structural disadvantages related to digital infrastructure, impacting their labor income or propensity to search for jobs?

The central approach here is to explore the factors that impact the income and job-seeking status of a representative cohort born in the 1980s in the United States and are the mainstay of the American labor force. To narrow the focus, I study the cohort of NLSY (National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth) born in the 1980s. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) is a sample of 12,686 men and women born during the years 1957 through 1964 and living in the United States when the survey began. Since people of the 1990s are just getting married and not having diverse marital and household statuses, and people of the 2000s and younger are not mostly entering the labor force, our data sets of income factors based on the NLSY97 cohort is the most up-to-date cohort worth analyzing. In the data set, 8984 respondents (4599 male, 4385 female) were surveyed 4 times respectively in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017.

I seek to understand the personal and household income dynamics of people born in the 1980s from 2010 to 2020 (before COVID-19). I want to consider what demographic (such as marital), personal (such as education, substance use), and situational factors play a significant role in determining the wage rates of the primary jobs of the individuals, household income, and spouse income. I want to examine the patterns of influence of these factors over a representative time frame of 2010 to 2020. Lastly, I will seek to build a model that predicts the odds that an individual will search for new full-time jobs and makes interpretations.

## 2 Data

### 2.1 Raw Data

I use the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics222The data set is free and open to the public at: https://www.bls.gov/nls/home.html. The NLSY97333The introductions of the data set are quoted from the official website of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. https://www.nlsinfo.org/ consists of a nationally representative sample of 8,984 men and women born between 1980 and 1984, living in the United States at the initial survey in 1997. Participants were aged 12 to 16 as of December 31, 1996. Interviews were conducted annually from 1997 to 2011 and biennially thereafter. The ongoing cohort has been surveyed 18 times as of now. Data are available from Round 1 (1997-98) through Round 18 (2017-18)444Please refer to the Appendix for the processed data sets.. In addition to personal demographics, education, and marital status, I incorporate variables capturing Internet usage frequency—an important measure of technological access in different local contexts.

The major sections of survey questions (variables) include Education, Training & Achievement Scores, Employment, Household, Geography & Contextual Variables, Parents, Family Process & Childhood, Dating, Marriage & Cohabitation, Sexual Activity, Pregnancy & Fertility, Children, Income, Assets & Program Participation, Health: Conditions & Practices, Attitudes, Expectations, Non-Cognitive Tests, Activities, and Crime & Substance Use. I handle the missing data of certain variables (such as e.g., spouse’s income in 2017) conservatively to preserve integrity.

### 2.2 Processed Data

The bulk of our analysis is based on four data sets named
  
income\_factors\_2011, income\_factors\_2013,
  
income\_factors\_2015, and income\_factors\_2017, which contain variables surveyed in the respective years and are selected from NLSY97 rounds 1-18. The major factors used in our data sets include sex, spouse income in the previous year, household gross income in the previous year, hourly wage rates in the previous year, region, whether job-seeking in the past three months, highest degree obtained, unemployment status (measured as the number of weeks unemployed in the last year), substance usage status (smoking and marijuana), household size, and income-to-poverty ratios. The summary statistics are presented as follows.

## 3 Empirical Methodology

### 3.1 Data Selection and Analysis Strategy

For the cross-sectional data analysis, I select 2011–2017 to avoid disruptions from the 2008–2009 crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, and because respondents were mostly in their 20s to early 30s during this stable economic expansion.

In addition to ensuring the cohorts are approximately 20 to 30 years old during the surveys, I choose the period from 2011 to 2017 because this is a period of continued economic expansion. The absence of economic downturns or recessions during this period allows for more consistency between models and enables us to observe trends with time series analysis.

This research specifically aims to examine how personal behavioral, demographic, and situational factors, such as race, education, and substance use, impact individual income dynamics and wage rates in the 21st century. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models are used to predict the wage rates of individuals’ primary jobs, while logistic regression is used to model the probability of a person seeking a job. Initially, this research begins with cross-sectional analysis by assuming individual years as independent. Subsequently, a preliminary longitudinal analysis will be conducted to account for changes in the importance of these factors over time and to examine the trends.

### 3.2 Income Trend Analysis

For an overview of labor income dynamics, I analyze trends for three major income metrics: spouse’s annual income (of the previous year), household gross annual income (of the previous year), and hourly wage rates. The correlation across years is tabulated below555Some of the correlations are very small due to the missing data points in some years..

To proceed from the correlation matrix, I examine whether the correlation matrix fits the AR (1) structure.

The first-order autoregressive [AR (1)] structure can be written as follows, with |ρ|<1|\rho|<1:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ui,t=ρ​ui,t−1+ei​tu\_{i,t}=\rho u\_{i,t-1}+e\_{it} |  |

Where

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E​(ei​t|xi,t,ui,t−1,xi,t−1,⋯)=0E(e\_{it}|x\_{i,t},u\_{i,t-1},x\_{i,t-1},\cdots)=0 |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E​(ei​t2|xi,t)=E​(ei​t2)=σ2E(e\_{it}^{2}|x\_{i,t})=E(e\_{it}^{2})=\sigma^{2} |  |

Assuming there are 4 selected years, say 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017, the covariance matrix structure should be as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Ω=σ21−ρ2​(1ρρ2ρ3ρ1ρρ2ρ2ρ1ρρ3ρ2ρ1)\Omega=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{1-\rho^{2}}\begin{pmatrix}1&\rho&\rho^{2}&\rho^{3}\\ \rho&1&\rho&\rho^{2}\\ \rho^{2}&\rho&1&\rho\\ \rho^{3}&\rho^{2}&\rho&1\end{pmatrix} |  |

It is evident that AR(1) is not appropriate: if the correlation matrix indeed follows the AR(1) structure, the correlation decreases exponentially from the principal diagonal to the subprime diagonal and beyond, following the pattern ρ,ρ2,ρ3,…\rho,\rho^{2},\rho^{3},\ldots etc. with |ρ|<1|\rho|<1. Here, the correlation from one year to the next is so low compared to our expectations. For exploratory purposes, I find that an AR(2) model may better fit the correlation matrix, indicating a positive correlation between income from the past two years and income for the current year in the NLSY97 cohort. Below, I illustrate the correlation patterns of wage, household gross income, and spouse income for the NLSY97 cohort.

### 3.3 Cross-Sectional Models

#### 3.3.1 OLS Model for Labor Income

I model hourly wage (or annual wage) as a function of demographics, education, substance use, and indicators of Internet usage. To reflect regional heterogeneity in digital infrastructure, I include geographic region as a key factor.

Our OLS model for labor income666There are three measures of income, such as spouse income, gross household income, and labor wages. Without loss of generality, I use labor wage as the response variable here to explain the procedure, which is the same if I use spouse income and gross household income as independent variables. is:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Wi​t=α+β1​Xi​t+β2​Zi​t+ei​tW\_{it}=\alpha+\beta\_{1}X\_{it}+\beta\_{2}Z\_{it}+e\_{it} |  |

In the OLS model, α\alpha is the time-invariant term, and ei​te\_{it} is the error term for individual ii at time tt, for which t=2011,2013,2015,2017t=2011,2013,2015,2017.

Xi​tX\_{it} represents the level of the individuals’ education for individual i at time t (no education, GED, high school, associate/junior college, bachelor’s, master’s, PhD, or professional degrees), and Zi​tZ\_{it} represents the demographic and socioeconomic regressors, including sex (binary dummy), marital status, region, substance use, and access/usage frequency of the internet (as a measure of financial conditions).

Given the efforts in improving GED education, most people tend to have completed GED according to the NLSY97 cohort data (only 746 in 2011, 647 in 2013, 616 in 2015, and 536 in 2017 out of 8984 survey participants did not complete a GED certificate). Thus, using a binary variable for education is no longer sufficient. I need to accurately reflect the multiple levels of education within the sample. It’s helpful to shift research interests to comparisons of education into three categories: having no education or GED, having completed high school or associate’s/junior college, or having a bachelor’s degree or above.

#### 3.3.2 Logistic Model for Job-Seeking Probabilities

To capture the binary decision of actively seeking employment, I use a logit model to measure the binary outcome of whether a person sought a job three months before the survey. Our analyses explicitly test whether frequent Internet usage—potentially enabling robust online search and digital networking—significantly correlates with job-search intensity.

The logit model for binary response is:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f​(yt=1|xt′,θ0)=Λ​(xt′​θ0)f(y\_{t}=1|x\_{t}^{{}^{\prime}},\theta\_{0})=\Lambda(x\_{t}^{{}^{\prime}}\theta\_{0}) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f​(yt=0|xt′,θ0)=1−Λ​(xt′​θ0)f(y\_{t}=0|x\_{t}^{{}^{\prime}},\theta\_{0})=1-\Lambda(x\_{t}^{{}^{\prime}}\theta\_{0}) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Λ​(γ):=eγ1+eγ\Lambda(\gamma):=\frac{e^{\gamma}}{1+e^{\gamma}} |  |

Thus, I need to maximize the following objective function:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Qn​(θ)=1n​∑i=1n{yt​log⁡(Λ​(xt′​θ0))+(1−yt)​log⁡(1−Λ​(xt′​θ0))}Q\_{n}(\theta)=\frac{1}{n}\sum\_{i=1}^{n}\{y\_{t}\log(\Lambda(x\_{t}^{{}^{\prime}}\theta\_{0}))+(1-y\_{t})\log(1-\Lambda(x\_{t}^{{}^{\prime}}\theta\_{0}))\} |  |

Using this logit model, the probability of searching for a job is modeled as:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | α+β1​Xi​t+β2​Zi​t+ei​t\alpha+\beta\_{1}X\_{it}+\beta\_{2}Z\_{it}+e\_{it} |  |

In the logit model, α\alpha is the time-invariant term, and ei​te\_{it} is the error term for individual ii at time tt, for which t = 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017. Xi​tX\_{it} and Zi​tZ\_{it} are just the same as those in the OLS model. Yi​t=0Y\_{i}t=0 the individual was not seeking for a job in the past three months, or 1 if the individual did seek a job in the past three months. Admittedly, there is a more direct question, “Did you want full-time work?”, but that question was only asked in the 2006 survey for the NLSY97 cohort. However, our focus is not just on employment status but job-seeking behavior. Fortunately, job-seeking behavior status was well recorded, so I used it as the binary response variable. In all income factors datasets, the categorical variables used are family background, job conditions, income and wealth, and personal demographics. In the Appendix, I explain some unique interpretations of the coefficients of dummy variables involved in the models with factor variables. The representative set of independent variables include socioeconomic and situational variables such as sex, region, education, marital status, Internet usage frequency, substance usage (marijuana or cigarettes), household size, income-to-poverty ratio, and the number of weeks unemployed.

In addition, I also include a two-stage least square procedure to estimate the employment days. If one is unemployed and wants to seek a job depending on her personal or family needs, she will likely be in the status of actively seeking jobs. To address the endogeneity arising from unemployment, I use the first stage regression to predict the number of weeks unemployed with all the independent variables and then include the predicted number of weeks unemployed in the regression on the entire job search probability.

## 4 Model Results and Interpretations

### 4.1 Labor Income OLS Results

I present the respective OLS models for labor income for 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 in Table 4 Labor Income OLS Results without Aggregating Categories and Table 5 Labor Income OLS Results with Categories Aggregated. Here the significant codes in the tables are 0.001 ‘\*\*\*’, 0.01 ‘\*\*’, and 0.05 ‘\*’. Aggregating the categories is beneficial as it helps avoid small counts in certain categories of Internet usage and marriage variables. Note that in 2015, due to the absence of hourly wage data for the main full-time job of the sample, I must use annual income as the response variable alternatively. Similarly, in 2013, I used smoking within the past 12 months as a proxy for marijuana usage, given the absence of specific marijuana data. Although not a perfect substitute, smoking is a reasonable proxy777In the subsample selected for 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 models, by looking at the unique ID of every respondent, I find that co-use of both substances is more common than tobacco or marijuana use only. due to similar addictive properties and health impacts.

The model indicates that most marital status and education categories are significant, while sex and internet usage are not. Before discussing and interpreting these results, I recognize the issue of too many categories causing small sample sizes and reducing model significance. To address this, I aggregated certain categories. For example, I combined “divorced,” “separated,” and “widowed” into a single category of “was married.” Similarly, education was simplified into “completed high school” and “did not complete high school.” This aggregation helps mitigate the impact of small counts and is theoretically justified. Our models across all 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 have large degrees of freedom, exceeding 4000, with more balanced counts.

I use ANOVA to test the significance of the factor variables. The results show that sex, region, and education are significant at the α=0.01\alpha=0.01 level, while internet usage frequency is significant at the α=0.1\alpha=0.1 level (with p-values around 0.060.06).

Our model shows that men earn approximately $4.63 more per hour than women. Individuals in the North Central and South regions earn $2.4 and $1.6 less per hour, respectively, compared to those in the Northeast, with no significant wage differences between the Northeast and West. This reflects regional economic disparities, with the West Coast and Northeast being more prosperous.

Being married is associated with a substantial increase (about $3) in hourly wage compared to never being married. This effect can be attributed to financial stability before marriage and increased workplace performance due to marital encouragement.

Education is the most significant factor for wage increases, with high school completion and bachelor’s degrees being critical milestones, each leading to at least a $5-per-hour wage increase. Higher education degrees, such as master’s and PhDs, further boost earnings.

These wage differences between categories are consistent from 2011 to 2017, and overall wage levels have increased over time.

### 4.2 Job-seeking Logistic Regression Results

In this section, I aggregate categories in the job-seeking logistic regression and present the results from four different models, as shown in the Appendix.

* •

  Table 6: Shows a logistic regression model of the probability of seeking jobs.
* •

  Table 7: Displays a logistic model where the number of weeks unemployed is estimated in the first stage using all other variables.
* •

  Table 8: Adds more situational variables to the standard logistic regression model of the probability of seeking jobs.
* •

  Table 9: Presents a two-staged least square estimation version of the model in Table 8.

Our findings indicate that higher education levels increase the likelihood of seeking full-time employment. Household income, however, has a relatively small effect, as indicated by its small coefficient. Additionally, higher parental education is associated with a greater likelihood of seeking full-time jobs. It’s important to note that the willingness to take a full-time job was assessed prospectively when the NLSY97 cohort was younger. Their actual job-seeking decisions in their 20s and 30s are influenced by the process of aging.

For the cross-sectional results in Table 1.3, the model shows strong significance for 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017. The West region shows low significance, indicating no significant difference in job search willingness between the West and Northeast.

Having married once (means both currently married or were married) significantly decreases one’s chance of “searching for a job in the past 3 months”. Marriage often correlates with economic security, or individuals would be more stable with their employment once they have married. Hence, they are less likely to lose or switch jobs.

Additionally, income-to-poverty ratio and household size are significant variables across all four years, though their influence is small compared to education and marital status. Unlike other factor variables which are mostly fixed for an individual within 10 years, these are good situational variables that change across time. Income-to-poverty ratio and household size are significant variables across all four years, though their influence is small compared to education and marital status.

I use chi-square statistics to evaluate the overall significance of the logistic models, calculating the overall p-value for each model. Including the income-to-poverty ratio and household size enhances the overall significance of the model. The chi-square distribution’s deviance and degrees of freedom can be calculated from the null and residual distribution in the logistic regression output.

Despite the small practical influence, I find that the p-value of the model in Table 8 is even smaller than the model in Table 6. Thus, income to income-to-poverty ratio and household size should be included in the model.

### 4.3 Discussion of Results

#### 4.3.1 Technological Access and Job-Seeking

Across multiple years (2011 to 2017), I observe that individuals with higher frequency of Internet usage—especially those accessing the Internet daily—are more likely to search for new jobs, all else equal. This relationship is particularly strong in early years (2013, 2015), suggesting that the digital divide could significantly influence labor market mobility.

#### 4.3.2 Regional Disparities and Digital Infrastructure

Wage outcomes continue to reflect longstanding regional inequalities; individuals in the Northeast and West generally reported higher hourly wages than those in the South or North Central regions. Our results suggest that differences in regional digital infrastructure could compound these inequalities, raising questions about whether computing resources and broadband access in disadvantaged regions are sufficient to facilitate equitable opportunities for job mobility.

#### 4.3.3 Marital Status, Education, and Sustainability

As in prior literature, marital status and education remain robust predictors of earnings. However, from a sustainability perspective, the interplay of local computing resources with these socio-demographic factors is critical: higher-educated or married individuals in regions with robust digital infrastructure can leverage online job platforms more effectively, potentially widening gaps with those lacking reliable connectivity.

#### 4.3.4 Implications for “Computing in Place”

Our findings underscore that digital resources are not uniformly distributed; local conditions (e.g., rural vs. urban broadband penetration, digital literacy, regional economic policies) shape how effectively workers can use technology to improve their labor prospects. This place-based lens reveals how technology can simultaneously be an “equalizer” of opportunity and a mechanism that amplifies systemic inequalities.

## 5 Serial Correlation & Autoregressive Structure

I explore potential serial correlation within income patterns over 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017. Typical methods include calculating residuals across cross-sections or time series or including previous years’ income as lag terms in the regression model.

Calculating residuals across cross-sections or time series was not feasible due to insufficient data points with valid responses across all four years. Therefore, I included lag terms (lag 1, lag 2, lag 3) of income variables in our OLS models. For example, in the Ordinary Least Square model for spouse income in 2016, I include spouse income in 2014, spouse income in 2012, and spouse income in 2010. Likewise, in the Ordinary Least Square model for spouse income in 2014, I include spouse income in 2012 and spouse income in 2010. The table for the OLS model for spouse income in 2016 and the table for the OLS model for spouse income in 2014 are included in the Appendix.

There is no obvious difference for significance models if I include weeks of unemployment. I find that the lag 1, lag 2, and lag 3 terms are all significant. To analyze the exact autoregressive structure of the correlation, I may output the inverse of the correlation matrix of the 2014 and 2016 spouse income models888Please refer to the Appendix for code for computation of the covariance matrix..

Table 3: Inverse matrix of the correlation matrix of spouse income in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016

|  | 2011 | 2013 | 2015 | 2017 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2011 | 0.4279 | -0.0346 | 0.0341 | 0.0226 |
| 2013 | -0.0346 | 0.8306 | 0.0003 | -0.0043 |
| 2015 | 0.0341 | 0.0003 | 0.7000 | -0.0354 |
| 2017 | 0.0226 | -0.0043 | -0.0354 | 0.7112 |

The inverse matrix indicates that off-diagonal terms are relatively small, suggesting no clear autoregressive structure with rapidly decaying correlations over time. This discrepancy may stem from missing data in the dataset, necessitating further modeling to verify the presence of an AR(2) structure.

## 6 Limitations and Future Directions

Our trend analysis is constrained by an unbalanced dataset with occasional missing data across years, primarily categorized as ‘valid skips’ due to the survey’s design allowing respondents to choose not to answer certain questions. Nearly all individuals exhibit at least one skipped variable in one year. Addressing this limitation by improving dataset balance and increasing interview frequency could significantly enhance the robustness of our research.

Future avenues include expanding our models to encompass the 2019 NLSY97 cohort, enabling a more comprehensive observation of trends. Recognizing the influence of economic downturns such as COVID-19 on future analyses is essential. Moreover, ongoing technological advancements and societal shifts over time may necessitate recalibrating model accuracy.

Further exploration into job-seeking motivations is essential. Our current linear logistic models may oversimplify the complexity of these behaviors. Incorporating nonlinear relationships or additional socioeconomic indicators could offer deeper insights into the multifaceted factors guiding job search decisions. Addressing potential simultaneity among regressors—such as how internet access impacts job-seeking channels and unemployment duration—remains crucial for refining model precision.

Job seekers may pursue employment for varied reasons, from reemployment necessity to income enhancement. Factors such as educational attainment and regional development levels play significant roles in job-seeking dynamics, with demographic attributes like sex and household size influencing risk tolerance towards job instability. Exploring nonlinear relationships, such as quadratic effects in income-to-poverty ratios, could yield more nuanced insights.

The extensive socioeconomic measures available in the NLSY dataset offer promising avenues for future research, allowing for refined categorizations of individuals based on their job-seeking objectives.

## 7 Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of labor income and job-seeking disparities among individuals born in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States. Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY97), I examined the impact of various demographic, personal, and situational factors on income levels and job-seeking behavior from 2010 to 2017. Our findings provide key insights into contemporary labor market dynamics.

Firstly, demographic factors such as marital status, education level, and regional location significantly influence labor income. Our analysis reveals that higher educational attainment is strongly associated with increased wage rates, with individuals holding bachelor’s degrees or higher earning substantially more than those with only high school education. Additionally, being married is correlated with higher wages, reflecting the potential economic stability provided by marriage.

Secondly, I identified notable regional disparities in income, with individuals in the Northeast and West earning more compared to those in the South and North Central regions. These findings underscore the persistent economic inequalities across different parts of the United States, highlighting the need for targeted regional economic policies.

Thirdly, our logistic regression analysis on job-seeking behavior indicates that higher education levels increase the likelihood of seeking full-time employment. Moreover, factors such as substance use, internet usage frequency, and weeks of unemployment also play significant roles in influencing job search activities. Interestingly, the presence of a higher income-to-poverty ratio and larger household sizes, although significant, had relatively smaller effects on job-seeking probabilities.

This study contributes to the literature on labor income and job-seeking disparities by providing updated empirical evidence on the determinants of income dynamics and employment decisions in the United States. Our findings emphasize the importance of education, marital status, and regional factors in shaping labor market outcomes, and they offer critical implications for policymakers aiming to reduce economic inequalities and improve labor market efficiency.

By emphasizing the localized, socio-technical fabric within which labor market processes unfold, this paper moves beyond a purely demographic or economic analysis of income dynamics. Our use of the NLSY97 dataset, augmented with variables related to digital access, reveals how “computing in place” can intersect with marital status, education, and household characteristics in determining both wages and job-seeking strategies. I call for continued, interdisciplinary work that foregrounds the political, material, and ethical consequences of uneven digital infrastructures as I strive toward sustainable and equitable futures in the developed labor markets like the United States.
